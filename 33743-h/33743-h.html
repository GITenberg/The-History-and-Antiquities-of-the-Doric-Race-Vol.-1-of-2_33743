From
The Translators' Preface
To The First Edition.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The History, of which an English translation is
now offered to the public, forms the second and
third volumes of a work by Professor C. O. Müller,
entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“Histories of Greek Tribes and Cities.”</span>
The first volume of this series was published separately
under the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“Orchomenos and the
Minyæ;”</span> and contains a most learned examination
of the mythology and early history of Orchomenos
and other towns of Bœotia, and of the migrations
of the Minyæ, together with other questions more
or less connected with these subjects. It is, in
every respect, a distinct and separate work from
the Dorians, comprised in the second and third volumes;
nor was it more incumbent on us to publish
a translation of that first volume, because it is
often referred to in the subsequent volumes, than of
the many other admirable works on Grecian history,
equally referred to, which are inaccessible to persons
not acquainted with the German language.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At a time when a large part of the present translation
had been completed, the translators communicated
by letter to Professor Müller their intention
with regard to his work on the Dorians, and requested
him to read the manuscript of their translation before
it was printed, in case they should have anywhere
committed any errors, or failed to catch the import
of his words. To this request Mr. Müller, though
not personally known by either of the translators,
not only acceded, but, with an unexpected, and indeed
unhoped-for liberality, expressed his willingness
to contribute to our translation all the alterations and
additions which his reading had suggested since the
appearance of the original work. The manuscript
was accordingly transmitted, and carefully revised,
corrected, and enlarged by the author. Of the value
of these changes it would perhaps be improper that
we should speak in the terms which they seem to us
to deserve: of their number, however, as this can be
brought to a certain test, we will venture to assert,
that few books undergo so great changes after their
first publication; and that the present work may be
in strictness considered, not only a translation, but a
new edition of the original. In making these changes,
it was also the author's wish to clear up ambiguities
or obscurity of meaning, either by a change in the
expression, or a fuller development of the thought:
and we cannot help hoping, that even to a person
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagev">[pg v]</span><a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
acquainted with German, our translation will thus be
found in many places more explicit and satisfactory
than the original text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides those alterations, which appear for the first
time in the following translation, the additions and
corrections published by the author in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction
to a scientific System of Mythology”</span> have
been here incorporated; and a Dissertation on the
early history of the Macedonian nation, published
separately by the author, some time after the appearance
of the Dorians, has been inserted in the Appendix.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not only has the small map of Macedonia, appended
to this Dissertation, been inserted in our
translation, in addition to the map of the Peloponnese,
which was alone contained in the original work,
but also a map of northern Greece, which, together
with the explanatory article inserted in the Appendix,
is now for the first time given to the public. These
three maps together furnish a complete geographical
picture of ancient Greece, from the promontory of
Tænarum to the north of Macedonia; and we may
be allowed to say, that in accuracy and fulness of
detail, they rival, if not excel, all other maps of the
same regions<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the printing of the whole work (with the
exception of the Appendix) had been completed, the
sheets were sent to Mr. Müller, by which means not
only the translation of the original, but also of the
manuscript additions, have received the approbation
of the author. Any discrepancies, therefore, which
may appear between the translation and the original
must be considered as sanctioned by the author. The
translators at the same time think it right to state,
in case Mr. Müller should be exposed to any misrepresentations
in his own country, that in making
their translation they did not consider themselves
bound to follow the letter of the original, and have
sometimes indulged in a free paraphrase: while in
some places they suggested more considerable
changes, on account of the difference between the
opinions on many important subjects which generally
prevail in England and Germany.

1. The Dorians derived their origin from those districts
in which the Grecian nation bordered towards
the north upon numerous and dissimilar races of barbarians.
As to the tribes which dwelt beyond these
boundaries we are indeed wholly destitute of information;
nor is there the slightest trace of any memorial
or tradition that the Greeks originally came from those
quarters. On these frontiers, however, the events took
place which effected an entire alteration in the internal
condition of the whole Grecian people, and here
were given many of those impulses, of which the
effects were so long and generally experienced. The
prevailing character of the events in question, was a
perpetual pressing forward of the barbarous races,
particularly of the Illyrians, into more southern districts;
yet Greece, although harassed, confined, nay
even compelled to abandon part of her territory, never
attempted to make a united resistance to their encroachments.
The cause of this negligence probably
was, that all her views being turned to the south, no
attention whatever was paid to the above quarters.

2. To begin then by laying down a boundary line
(which may be afterwards modified for the sake of
greater accuracy), we shall suppose this to be the
mountain ridge, which stretches from Olympus to the
west as far as the Acroceraunian mountains (comprehending
the Cambunian ridge and mount Lacmon),
and in the middle comes in contact with the Pindus
chain, which stretches in a direction from north to
south. The western part of this chain separates the
furthest Grecian tribes from the great Illyrian nation,
which extended back as far as the Celts in the south
of Germany. Every clue respecting the connexion,
peculiarities, and original language of this people
must be interesting, and the dialects of the Albanians,
especially of those who inhabit the mountains where
the original customs and language have been preserved
in greater purity, will afford materials for inquiry.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
For our present purpose it will be sufficient to state,
that they formed the northern boundary of the Grecian
nation, from which they were distinguished both by
their language and customs.

dialect was full of Greek radical words. And
that these had not been introduced by the royal family
(which was Hellenic by descent or adoption of manners)
is evident from the fact, that many signs of the
most simple ideas (which no language ever borrows
from another) were the same in both, as well as from
the circumstance that these words do not appear in
their Greek form, but have been modified according to
a native dialect.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> In the Macedonian dialect there

4. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Thessalians</span></span>, as well as the Macedonians,
were, as it appears, an Illyrian race, who
subdued a native Greek population; but in this case
the body of the interlopers was smaller, while the
numbers and civilization of the aboriginal inhabitants
were considerable. Hence the Thessalians resembled
the Greeks more than any of the northern races with
which they were connected: hence their language in
particular was almost purely Grecian, and indeed bore
perhaps a greater affinity to the language of the ancient
epic poets than any other dialect.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> But the chief
peculiarities of this nation with which we are acquainted
were not of a Grecian character. Of this
their national dress,<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> which consisted in part of the
flat and broad-brimmed hat καυσία and the chlamys
(which last was common to both nations, but was unknown
to the Greeks of Homer's time, and indeed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
long afterwards,<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> until adopted as the costume of the
equestrian order at Athens), is a sufficient example.
The Thessalians, moreover, were beyond a doubt the
first to introduce into Greece the use of cavalry. More
important distinctions however than that first alleged
are perhaps to be found in their impetuous and passionate
character, and the low state of their intelligence.
The taste for the arts shown by the wealthy house of
the Scopadæ proves no more that such was the disposition
of the whole people, than the existence of the
same qualities in Archelaus argues their prevalence in
Macedonia. This is sufficient to distinguish them
from the race of the Greeks, so highly endowed by
nature. We are therefore induced to conjecture that
this nation, which a short time before the expedition of
the Heraclidæ, migrated from Thesprotia, and indeed
from the territory of Ephyra (Cichyrus) into the plain
of the Peneus, had originally come from Illyria. On
the other hand indeed, many points of similarity in the
customs of the Thessalians and Dorians might be
brought forward. Thus for example, the love for the
male sex (that usage peculiar to the Dorians) was also
common among the Illyrians, and the objects of affection
were, as at Sparta, called ἀίται;<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> the women also,
as amongst the Dorians, were addressed by the title of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ladies</span></span> (δέσποιναι), a title uncommon in Greece, and
expressive of the estimation in which they were held.<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>
A great freedom in the manners of the female sex was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nevertheless customary among the Illyrians, who in
this respect bore a nearer resemblance to the northern
nations.<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> Upon the whole, however, these migrations
from the north had the effect of disseminating among
the Greeks manners and institutions which were
entirely unknown to their ancestors, as represented
by Homer.

5. We will now proceed to inquire what was the
extent of territory gained by the Illyrians in the west
of Greece. Great part of Epirus had in early times
been inhabited by Pelasgians,<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> to which race the inhabitants
of Dodona are likewise affirmed by the best
authorities to have belonged, as well as the whole
nation of Thesprotians;<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> also the Chaonians at the
foot of the Acroceraunian mountains,<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> and the Chones,
Œnotrians, and Peucetians on the opposite coast of
Italy, are said to have been of this race.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> The ancient
buildings, institutions, and religious worship of the
Epirots, are also manifestly of Pelasgic origin. We
suppose always that the Pelasgians were Greeks,
and spoke the Grecian language: an opinion in support
of which we will on this occasion only adduce a
few arguments. It must then be borne in mind, that
all the races whose migrations took place at a late
period, such as the Achæans, Ionians, Dorians, were
not (the last in particular) sufficiently powerful or
numerous to effect a complete change in the customs
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of a barbarous population;<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> that many districts, Arcadia
and Perrhæbia, for instance, remained entirely
Pelasgic, without being inhabited by any nation not of
Grecian origin; that the most ancient names, either
of Grecian places or mentioned in their traditions,
belonged indeed to a different era of the dialect, but
not to another language; that finally, the great similarity
between the Latin and Greek can only be explained
by supposing the Pelasgic language to have
formed the connecting link. Now the nations of
Epirus were almost reduced to a complete state of
barbarism by the operation of causes, which could only
have had their origin in Illyria;<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> and in the historic
age, the Ambracian bay was the boundary of Greece.
In later times, more than half of Ætolia ceased to be
Grecian, and without doubt adopted the manners and
language of the Illyrians;<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> from which point

6. The Illyrians were in these ancient times also
bounded on the east by the Phrygians and Thracians,
as well as by the Pelasgians. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phrygians</span></span> were
at this time the immediate neighbours of the Macedonians
in Lebæa, by whom they were called Brygians
(Βρύγες, Βρύγοι, Βρίγες);<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> they dwelt at the foot of
the snowy Bermius, where the fabulous rose-gardens
of king Midas were situated, while walking in which
the wise Silenus was said to have been taken prisoner.
They also fought from this place (as the Telegonia of
Eugammon related)<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> with the Thesprotians of Epirus.
At no great distance from hence were the Mygdonians,
the people nearest related to the Phrygians. According
to Xanthus, this nation did not migrate to
Asia until after the Trojan war.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> But, in the first
place, the Cretan traditions begin with religious rites

and, secondly, the Armenians, who were beyond a doubt
of a kindred race to the Phrygians,<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> were considered

therefore be sufficient to recognise the same race of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
men in Armenia, Asia Minor, and at the foot of
mount Bermius, without supposing that all the Armenians
and Phrygians emigrated from the latter
settlement on the Macedonian coast. The intermediate
space between Illyria and Asia, a district across
which numerous nations migrated in ancient times,
was peopled irregularly from so many sides, that the
national uniformity which seems to have once existed
in those parts was speedily deranged. The most important
documents respecting the connexion between
the Phrygian and other nations are the traces that
remain of its dialect. It was well known in Plato's
time that many primitive words of the Grecian language
were to be recognised with a slight alteration
in the Phrygian, such as πῦρ, ὕδωρ, χύων;<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> and the
great similarity of grammatical structure which the
Armenian now displays with the Greek, must be referred
to this original connexion.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> The Phrygians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in Asia must, however, have been intermixed with
Syrians, who not only established themselves on the
right bank of the Halys, but on the left also in
Lycaonia,<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>
and as far as Lycia,<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> and accordingly adopted
much of the Syrian language and religion.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> Their
enthusiastic and frantic ceremonies had doubtless
always formed part of their religion: these they had
in common with their immediate neighbours the Thracians:
but the ancient Greeks appear to have been
almost entirely unacquainted with such rites.

7. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Thracians</span></span>, who settled in Pieria at the
foot of mount Olympus, and from thence came down
to mount Helicon, as being the originators of the
worship of Dionysus and the Muses, and the fathers
of Grecian poetry,<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> are a nation of the highest importance
in the history of civilization. We cannot
but suppose that they spoke a dialect very similar
to the Greek, since otherwise they could not have had
any considerable influence upon the latter people.
They were in all probability derived originally from
the country called Thrace in later times, where the
Bessians, a tribe of the nation of the Satræ,<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>
at the foot of Mount Pangæum, presided over the oracle of
Dionysus. Whether the whole of the populous races
of Edones, Odomantians, Odrysians, Treres, &amp;c. are
to be considered as identical with the Thracians in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pieria, or whether it is not more probable that these
barbarous nations<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> received from the Greeks their
general name of Thracians, with which they had been
familiar from early times, are questions which I shall
not attempt to determine. Into these nations, however,
a large number of Pæonians subsequently penetrated,
who had passed over at the time of a very
ancient migration of the Teucrians, together with the
Mysians.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> To this Pæonian race the Pelagonians, on
the banks of the Axius, belonged; who also advanced
into Thessaly, as will be shown hereafter. Of the
Teucrians, however, we know nothing, excepting that
in concert with (Pelasgic) Dardanians they founded
the city of Troy,—where the language in use was
probably allied to the Grecian, and distinct from the
Phrygian.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>

8. Now it is within the mountainous barriers above
described that we must look for the origin of the
nations which in the heroic mythology are always
represented as possessing dominion and power, and are
always contrasted with an aboriginal population.
These, in my opinion, were northern branches of the
Grecian nation, which had overrun and subdued the
Greeks who dwelt further south. The most ancient
abode of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hellenes</span></span> Proper (who in mythology
are merely a small nation in Phthia<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>) was situated,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
according to Aristotle, in Epirus, near Dodona, to
whose god Achilles<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>
prays, as being the ancient protector
of his family. In all probability the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Achæans</span></span>,
the ruling nation both of Thessaly and of Peloponnesus,
in the mythical times, were of the same race and origin
as the Hellenes. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Minyans</span></span>, Phlegyans, Lapithæ,
and Æolians of Corinth and Salmone, came originally
from the districts above Pieria, on the frontiers of
Macedonia, where the very ancient Orchomenus,
Minya, and Salmonia or Halmopia were situated.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> Nor
is there less obscurity with regard to the northern settlements
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ionians</span></span>; they appear, as it were, to
have fallen from heaven into Attica and Ægialea: they
were not, however, by any means identical with the
aboriginal inhabitants of these districts, and had, perhaps,
detached themselves from some northern, probably
Achæan, race.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>
Lastly, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dorians</span></span> are
mentioned in ancient legends and poems as established
in one extremity of the great mountain-chain of Upper
Greece, viz. at the foot of Olympus; there are, however,
reasons for supposing, that at an earlier period
they had dwelt at its other northern extremity, at the
furthest limit of the Grecian nation.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. We now turn our attention to the singular
nation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hylleans</span></span> (Ὑλλεῖς, Ὕλλοι), which is
supposed to have dwelt in Illyria, but is in many respects
connected in a remarkable manner with the
Dorians. The real place of its abode can hardly be
laid down; as the Hylleans are never mentioned in
any historical narrative, but always in mythical legends;
and they appear to have been known to the geographers
only from mythological writers. Yet they are generally
placed in the islands of Melita and Black-Corcyra,
to the south of Liburnia.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> Now the name of the
Hylleans agrees strikingly with that of the first and
most noble tribe of the Dorians. Besides which, it is
stated, that, though dwelling among Illyrian races,
these Hylleans were nevertheless genuine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greeks</span></span>.
Moreover they, as well as the Doric Hylleans, were
supposed to have sprung from Hyllus, a son of Hercules,
whom that hero begot upon Melite, the daughter
of Ægæus:<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> here the name Ægæus refers to a river
in Corcyra, Melite to the island just mentioned.
Apollo was the chief god of the Dorians; and so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
likewise these Hylleans were said to have concealed
under the earth, as the sign of inviolable sanctity, that
instrument of such importance in the religion of
Apollo, a tripod.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> The country of the
Hylleans is described as a large peninsula, and compared to Peloponnesus:
it is said to have contained fifteen cities,
which, however, had not a more real existence than
the peninsula as large as Peloponnesus on the
Illyrian coast. How all these statements are to be
understood is hard to say. It appears, however, that
they can only be reconciled as follows: the Doric
Hylleans had a tradition, that they came originally
from these northern districts, which then bordered on
the Illyrians, and were afterwards occupied by that
people; and there still remained in those parts some
members of their tribe, some other Hylleans. This
notion of Greek Hylleans in the very north of Greece,
who also were descended from Hercules, and also worshipped
Apollo, was taken up and embellished by the
poets; although it is not likely that any one had really
ever seen these Hylleans and visited their country.
Like the Hyperboreans, they existed merely in tradition
and imagination. It is possible also that the Corcyræans,
in whose island there was an <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyllæan</span></span>”</span>
harbour,<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> may have contributed to the formation
of these legends, as is shown by some circumstances
pointed out above; but it cannot be supposed that the
whole tradition arose from Corcyræan colonies.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. Here we might conclude our remarks on this
subject, did not the following important question deserve
some consideration. What relation can we suppose
to have existed between the races which migrated
into those northern districts, and the native tribes, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what between the different races of Greece itself? All
inquiries on this subject lead us back to the Pelasgians,
who although not found in every part of ancient Greece
(for tradition makes so wide a distinction between them
and many other nations, that no confusion ever takes
place),<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> yet occur almost universally wherever early
civilization, ancient settlements, and worships of peculiar
sanctity and importance existed. And in fact
there is no doubt that most of the ancient religions of
Greece owed their origin to this race. The Zeus and
Dione of Dodona; Zeus and Heré of Argos; Hephæstus
and Athené of Athens; Demeter and Cora
of Eleusis; Hermes and Artemis of Arcadia, together
with Cadmus and the Cabiri of Thebes, cannot properly
be referred to any other origin. We must therefore
attribute to that nation an excessive readiness in
creating and metamorphosing objects of religious worship,
so that the same fundamental conceptions were
variously developed in different places; a variety which
was chiefly caused by the arbitrary neglect of, or adherence
to, particular parts of the same legend. In
many places also we may recognise the sameness of
character which pervaded the different worships of the
above gods; everywhere we see manifested in symbols,
names, rites, and legends, a uniformity of ideas and
feelings. The religions introduced from Phrygia and
Thrace, such as that of the Cretan Zeus and Dionysus
or Bacchus, may be easily distinguished by their more
enthusiastic character from the native Pelasgic worship.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The Phœnician and Egyptian religions lay at a great
distance from the early Greeks, were almost unknown
even where they existed in the immediate neighbourhood,
were almost unintelligible when the Greeks attempted
to learn them, and repugnant to their nature
when understood. On the whole, the Pelasgic worship
appears to form part of a simple elementary
religion, which easily represented the various forms
produced by the changes of nature in different climates
and seasons, and which abounded in expressive signs
for all the shades of feeling which these phenomena
awakened.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. On the other hand, the religion of the northern
races (who as being of Hellenic descent are put in
contrast with the Pelasgians) had in early times taken
a more moral turn, to which their political relations
had doubtless contributed. The heroic life (which is
no fiction of the poets), the fondness for vigorous and
active exertion, the disinclination to the harmless occupations
of husbandry, which is so remarkably seen in
the conquering race of the Hellenes, necessarily
awakened and cherished an entirely different train of
religious feeling. Hence the Zeus Hellanius of
Æacus, the Zeus Laphystius of Athamas, and, finally,
the Doric Zeus, whose son is Apollo, the prophet and
warrior,<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> are rather representations of the moral order
and harmony of the universe, after the ancient method,
than of the creative powers of nature. I do not however
deny, that there was a time when these different
views had not as yet taken a separate direction. Thus
it may be shown, that the Apollo Lyceus of the Dorians
conveyed nearly the same notions as the Zeus Lycæus
of the Arcadians, although the worship of either deity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was developed independently of that of the other. Thus
also certain ancient Arcadian and Doric customs had,
in their main features, a considerable affinity. The
points of resemblance in these different worships can
be only perceived by comparison: tradition presents,
at the very first outset, an innumerable collection of
discordant forms of worship belonging to the several
races, but without explaining to us how they came to
be thus separated. For these different rites were not
united into a whole until they had been first divided;
and both by the connexion of worships and by the influence
of poetry new combinations were introduced,
which differed essentially from those of an earlier date.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. The language of the ancient Grecian race
(which, together with its religion, forms the most ancient
record of its history) must, if we may judge from
the varieties of dialect and from a comparison with the
Latin language, have been very perfect in its structure,
and rich and expressive in its flexions and formations;
though much of this was polished off by the Greeks
of later ages: in early times, distinctness and precision
in marking the primitive words and the inflections
being more attended to than facility of utterance.
Wherever the ancient forms had been preserved, they
sounded foreign and uncouth to more modern ears;
and the language of later times was greatly softened,
in comparison with the Latin. But the peculiarities of
the pure Doric dialect are (wherever they were not
owing to a faithful preservation of archaic forms) actual
deviations from the original dialect, and consequently
they do not occur in Latin; they bear, if I may be allowed
the expression, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">northern</span></em> character. The use
of the article, which did not exist in the Latin language
or in that of epic poetry, can be ascribed to no other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cause than to immigrations of new tribes, and especially
to that of the Dorians. Its introduction must, as in
the Romance languages, be almost considered as the
sign of a great revolution. The peculiarities of the
Doric dialect must have existed before the period of
the migrations; since thus only can it be explained
how peculiar forms of the Doric dialect were common
to Crete, Argos, and Sparta: the same is also true of
the dialects which are generally considered as subdivisions
of the Æolic; the only reason for the resemblance
of the language of Lesbos to that of Bœotia being, that
Bœotians migrated at that period to Lesbos. The peculiarities
of the Ionic dialect may, on the other hand,
be viewed in great part as deviations caused by the
genial climate of Asia;<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> for the language of the Attic
race, to which the Ionians were most nearly related,
could hardly have differed so widely from that of the
colonies of Athens, if the latter had not been greatly
changed.<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a>

1. <span class="tei tei-q">“From early times the Dorians and Ionians were
the chief races of the Grecian nation; the latter of
Pelasgic, the former of Hellenic origin; the latter
an aboriginal people, the former a people much addicted
to wandering. For the former, when under
the dominion of Deucalion, dwelt in Phthiotis; and
in the time of Dorus, the son of Hellen, they inhabited
the country at the foot of Ossa and Olympus,
which was called Hestiæotis. Afterwards, however,
being driven from Hestiæotis by the Cadmeans,
they dwelt under mount Pindus, and were called the
Macednian nation. From thence they again migrated
to Dryopis; and having passed from Dryopis
into Peloponnesus, they were called the Doric
race.”</span><a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>

This connected account cannot be considered as derived
immediately from ancient tradition; but can only
be viewed as an attempt of the father of history to
arrange and reconcile various legends. Nor indeed is
it difficult to discover and examine the steps of the
argument which led him to this conclusion. It is
clear that he considers the genealogy of Hellen,<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> viz.
that he was the son of Deucalion and father of Dorus,
Xuthus, and Æolus, as an historical fact; although it
is at least more recent than the poems of Homer,
where the name of Hellenes does not include these
races, but is the appellation of a single nation in
Phthiotis: and that his object is to establish the position,
that the Dorians were the genuine Hellenes.
Now since Deucalion, the father of Hellen and grandfather
of Dorus, was supposed to have dwelt in Phthiotis,<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>
Herodotus represents the Dorians as also coming
from Phthiotis; although the people meant in these
legends by the names of Deucalion and Hellen were
the real ancient Hellenes, the Myrmidons,<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> who were
afterwards under the dominion of the Æacidæ,<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> and
are entirely distinct from the Dorians. Dorus was
next represented as succeeding Hellen as king of the
same people; and then, since the name of Dorus was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in these fabulous accounts connected with Hestiæotis,
he infers that the Dorians went thither from Phthiotis.
But the modern mythologist must of course abandon
this whole deduction as unfounded; and he can only
adopt the datum from which the historian started;
namely, that, according to ancient tradition, <span class="tei tei-q">“Dorus
dwelt at the foot of Olympus and Ossa.”</span> Here then
the real fact presents itself to us. The chain of Olympus,
the divider of nations, whose lofty summit is still
called by the inhabitants the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">celestial mansion</span></span>, is the
place in which the Dorians first appear in the history
of Greece.

2. The mountain-valley, which in later times bore
the name of Thessaly, was bounded to the west by
Pindus, to the south by Othrys, to the east by Pelion
and Ossa, and to the north by Olympus, under which
name the ancient writers, for example Herodotus, also
include the chain which in after-times (probably from
an Illyrian word)<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> was called the Cambunian mount.
The course of the Peneus is so situated as to divide the
open plain to the south, the ancient Pelasgic Argos,
from the mountainous district to the north; towards the
north-east it breaks through the mountain-ridge, dividing
Ossa from Olympus; here too the river creeps
under the loftier heights of mount Olympus;<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> so that
the path passes along the side of the more rugged and
precipitous Ossa. This ravine was known by the ancient
generic name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempea</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempe</span></span>
(the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cut</span></span>,
from τέμνω), and has been often poetically described,
but seldom sufficiently considered as bearing upon the
history of Greece.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>

Before entering the pass, the traveller crosses a
small round valley, agreeably situated; at the end of
which on the left hand, where the mountains approach
one another on both sides, was the ancient fortress of
Gonnus (or Gonni), distant 160 stadia from Larissa,
the chief city of the plain.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> From this point the mountains
close upon one another more rapidly, until they
rise on both sides of the glen in two rocky parapets,
forming a gully, where in many places a path has been
hewn along the river. About the middle of this path
there stands now, upon a bold projection of Ossa, a
fortress of Roman construction called Horæo-Castro,
covering also a cross glen of that mountain: it was
there probably that the strong-hold Gonnocondylum
stood; which appears to have taken its name from the
<span class="tei tei-q">“windings”</span> of the valley.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> Not far from this spot is
the narrowest part of the ravine, hardly 100 feet in
width: which is stated in an inscription to have been
fortified by L. Cassius Longinus, the proconsul and
partisan of J. Cæsar; but, without the aid of fortification,
a few armed men would probably have been able
to stop the progress of a force many times their number.
The region has nothing beautiful or agreeable in
its appearance, but presents rather a look of savage
wildness: the perpendicular masses of rock of the
same kind of stone appear, as it were, to have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rent asunder, and are without any covering of trees or
grass; the blackness of the shadows in the deep hollow,
and the dull echoes, increase the gloominess of
the impression: beneath bubble the silver waters of the
Peneus (ἀργυροδίνης).<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> Not far from this narrow
passage the defile opens towards the sea, to which the
Peneus flows through marshes; and from hence may
be seen the smiling country of Pieria, on the eastern
side of Olympus, particularly the plains of Phila, Heracleum,
and Leibethrum, which lead onwards to the
southern parts of Macedonia.

3. This is the only road between Thessaly and the
northern districts, which passes in its whole length
along a valley; all the others are mountain-passes.
Such was the other road to Macedonia, which crossed
mount Olympus (ἐσβολὴ Ὀλυμπική).<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> This
road, too, begins at the strongly-fortified city of Gonnus, the key
of the country towards the north; and it then goes
along the southern side of Olympus, till it reaches the
cities of Azorum and Doliche. Between these two
towns is a place where three ways met.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> The chief
road passes in a northerly direction over the summit
of the Cambunian chain to the Macedonian highlands;
and it was here that Xerxes set fire to the woods in
order to open a passage for his army, which the
Greeks had expected along the more practicable way
through Pieria and the valley of Tempe; and it was
often in the Roman wars traversed by large armies.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
From the south of Olympus two difficult mountain
roads led over the heights of Olympus, connecting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Northern Thessaly with Pieria. The one avoided the
valley of Tempe, as it passed by the fortress of Lapathus
to the north of that defile,<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> then along the small
lake of Ascurias, whence there was a view of the
town of Dium on the sea-coast, at the distance of 96
stadia; after which it descended into the plains of
Pieria. We should, however, more particularly notice
the other road, taking a more northern direction, and
passing over the lofty sides of Olympus, where formerly
there stood the castle of Petra, and the temple
of the Pythian Apollo, commonly called Pythium,
together with a village of the same name,<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> the height
of which Xenagoras, by a geometrical measurement,
ascertained to be 6096 Grecian feet.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>
From this point
there was a mountain-pass leading down to the coast
to Heracleum and Phila in Pieria, and another way
led along the ridge of Olympus by difficult and dangerous
passages, as far as Upper Macedonia.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>

These mountain-passes and defiles have not been
explored by any modern traveller; but it was important
for our subject to discover their position from the
writings of the ancients. Not only did Perseus and
Æmilius Paulus here contend for the fate of Macedonia,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but it was in this region that the Greek nations
of the heroic age disputed the possession of the
fertile Thessaly. There was once a time when through
these passes the nations pressed down, to whose lot
the finest parts of Greece were once to fall; here every
step was gained with labour, while the sons of the
mountain inured themselves to hardships in their incessant
wars. Of the numerous citadels which in
these districts cover every important point, the greater
number were probably built at a very early period.
Thus there were three fortresses<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> to defend the pass of
Olympus, or the road from Gonnus to Azorum and
Doliche, which two places, together with Pythium on
the mountain, were comprehended under the name of
the Pelagonian Tripolis.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a>

4. The highlands which border on Macedonia are
so rarely mentioned in Grecian history, that we find
in them few names of places, while in the valley of the
Peneus there were always some traditional and historical
memorials extant. For although the northern
mountains were not destitute of fountains, grassy
slopes, and fertile pastures, still the nations continually
pressed downward to the fertile lands of the valley. In
this plain Gonnus and Elatea are succeeded by Mopsium
upon the right, and Gyrton and Phalanna on the
left of the stream; and soon afterwards Larissa stood
in the midst of the open country,<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> which had been
once deposited from the stagnant waters of the Peneus,
and being constantly irrigated, always produced a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
plentiful crop. To the west of Larissa, in a narrower
part of the valley, where the hills approach the river
more from the north side, there stood, 40 stadia from
Larissa, the town of Argura,<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> and at the same distance
again the fort of Atrax; on the northern bank of the
river were the celebrated city of Pelinna<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> and the
castle of Pharcedon;<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> higher up on the left bank,
where the mountains on the north begin to recede and
form another plain, was the ancient city of Tricca.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>
Between Tricca and Pelinna stood, as it appears, the
city of Œchalia, so celebrated in mythology; the ruins
of which have been perhaps discovered by a traveller
in some ancient walls of massive structure,<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> of which
Pouqueville saw many in this district. If now we
follow the Peneus, which runs from the north-west,
higher up the stream than Tricca, we come to the
mountain district of Hestiæotis. At about three and
a half hours from Tricca<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> is now situated the convent

were two ways, one leading higher up the Peneus in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

these rocks. According to Strabo, Gomphi (in the
north-west), Tricca (in the south-west), Pelinna (in
the north-east), and the more recent city of Metropolis
(in the south-east), formed a square of fortresses, in
the middle of which was the ancient Ithome; which
Homer, from the steepness of the rock on which it
stood, calls the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">precipitous</span></span>
(κλωμακόεσσα or κλιμακόεσσα).<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>
From Meteora the Peneus may be followed
in a northerly direction to its origin from two small
streams; whence there was a path which wound over
the high chain of Pindus, and thus reached the
country of Epirus. This was in ancient times the
road which connected the two countries, and there still
remain on it several Cyclopian walls, the strongholds
of former ages.

5. There had dwelt in the valley of the Peneus from
the earliest times a Pelasgic nation, which offered up
thanks to the gods for the possession of so fruitful a
territory at the festival of Peloria.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> Their habits were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
doubtless adapted to the nature of the country, which
has still the same effect on the modern inhabitants;
those who dwell near the river being of a soft and
peaceable disposition, while the mountaineers are of a
stronger and freer turn of mind.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> Larissa was

who had retired into the mountains became the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Perrhæbian</span></span>
nation, and always retained a certain degree
of independence. In the Homeric catalogue the
Perrhæbians are mentioned as dwelling on the hill
Cyphus under Olympus, and on the banks of the
Titaresius, which, flowing along the western edge of
Olympus, is distinguished by its clear and therefore
dark-coloured stream, from the muddy and white waters
of the Peneus.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> At the present day the inhabitants of

population.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>
The ancients however were reminded by the Titaresius
of the Styx and of the infernal regions, not from any
natural circumstance, but because both among these
Perrhæbians and the Hellopian Pelasgians the name
and worship of Dodona had been established.<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> Accordingly
there seems to have been in both places a
Ψυχοπομπεῖον, or oracle of the dead. The prince of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these Perrhæbians was called Guneus. So much may
be gathered from the passage in Homer. Afterwards,
in historical times, we find the Perrhæbians having
extended their limits to the Cambunian mountains, the
pass of Tempe, and the Peneus; and reaching to the
west beyond the chain of Pindus.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> Gonnus and Atrax

maintained themselves in the mountains, even when
the Thessalians had seized upon the plain, not indeed
as an independent, but still as a separate, and, until the
Macedonian supremacy, as an Amphictyonic nation.

6. The plain on either side of the Peneus was however
occupied by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lapithæ</span></span>, a race which derived
its origin from Almopia in Macedonia, and was at least
very nearly connected with the Minyans and Æolians
of Ephyra.<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> If it be allowed to speak of this heroic
race, of superhuman strength and courage, in the same
terms as of a real nation, we should say that the towns
Elatea, Gyrton, Mopsium, Larissa, Atrax, Œchalia,
Ithome, and Tricca, were under their dominion. Our
reason is, that the Lapithæ, Elatus, Cæneus, Mopsus,
Coronus, Eurytus and Hippodameia, were considered
by popular tradition as inhabitants of the above towns;
a belief indicated by the names of several of these
heroes. The two last of these towns were the native
places of the Asclepiadæ, whom the genealogical and
other legends always represent as connected with the
Lapithæ. In Homer the inhabitants of Tricca,
Ithome, and Œchalia are represented as following the
sons of Æsculapius; those of Argissa, Gyrton, Orthe,
Elone, and Oloosson are headed by the descendants of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Lapithæ. Now from the researches mentioned by
Strabo, it would seem that Orthe was the fortress of
Phalanna, Argissa the town Argura, both on the river
Peneus; Elone was a small town on mount Olympus,
as also Oloosson;<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> and it appears that the Homeric
catalogue agrees well enough with the other traditions,
and supposes the Lapithæ to have occupied the valley
of the Peneus, with some parts of the mountainous
country to the north.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Thus much it was necessary to premise, in order
to give a faithful description of the spot in which the
Dorians first make their appearance in the traditions of
Greece. They bordered on the Lapithæ, but inhabited
the mountain district of Hestiæotis, according to Herodotus,<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a>
instead of the champaign country, like the latter
race. Yet the same passage of that author implies that
Tempe was within the territory of Hestiæotis, and belonged
at that time to the Dorians; we shall see hereafter
how much this account is confirmed by the altar
of the Pythian Apollo in this valley.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> It will moreover
be rendered probable that the Pythium above mentioned
was situated on the mountain heights. Hence
we may well suppose the whole Tripolis to have at one
time belonged to the Dorians; since even Azorium was
not always inhabited by Illyrian Pelagones, but had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
once been held by the Hellenes.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a> It is also probable
that Cyphus, a town said to have belonged to the
Perrhæbians, was under the dominion of the Dorians;
since this race possessed in their second settlement a
town called Acyphas.<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> It is remarkable that no direct
and positive account of any Doric town in this district
has been preserved, a circumstance to be attributed to
the loss of the epic poem of Ægimius.

the author probably lived about the 30th Olympiad, 660 B.C.
in the last period of epic poetry),<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a>
celebrated the most ancient exploits of the Doric race.
Thus it sung how Ægimius, the Doric prince, whilst
engaged in a difficult and dangerous war with the
Lapithæ, called to his assistance the wandering
Hercules, and by the promise of a third part of the
territory obtained his alliance; by which means the
enemies were beaten, their prince slain, and the disputed
territory conquered.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> The name of the poem

town of Œchalia also formed, as I conjecture, part of
the subject. Ægimius was, however, supposed to reign
in Hestiæotis, merely because the Dorians bordered in
this direction upon the Lapithæ; he was easily carried
over to the second settlements of the race under mount
Œta.<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> This hero is in general the mythical progenitor

of the Dorians are stated to be descended from him, viz. the
Dymanes and Pamphylians; the third and most distinguished,

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by Ægimius. And as the land in the Doric states was
equally divided between these three tribes, Hercules
was fabled to have received for his descendants a third
part of the territory, which belonged of right to the
Hylleans. This triple division of the land was expressly
mentioned by the epic poet, who used the word
τριχάϊκες to express that the Dorians had obtained
and shared among themselves, at a distance from their
native country (chiefly in Peloponnesus),<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> a territory

9. One event which, even if it had not been noticed
by tradition, would still have been felt and recognised
from the effects it produced, is the migration of the
Dorians from the district of Olympus to Crete. It is,
indeed, a wonderful migration, being from one end of
the Grecian world to the other, and it presents a striking
anomaly in the history of the ancient colonies. We
must suppose that the Dorians, whilst in their first
settlements, excluded from the plain, and pressed by
want, or restless from inactivity, constructed piratical
canoes, manned these frail and narrow barks with
soldiers, who themselves worked at the oars, and thus
being changed from mountaineers into seamen—the
Normans of Greece—set sail for the distant island of
Crete. The earliest trace of the migration in question
is found in the Odyssey, in which poem it is
mentioned that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thrice-divided</span></span> Dorians formed a
part of the population of Crete.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> Andron
states, even with geographical accuracy, that these Dorians came
to Crete from Hestiæotis, at that time called Doris,
under Tectaphus, the son of Dorus, together with
Achæans and some Pelasgians who had remained in
Thessaly.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> According to Dicæarchus, the Dorians
migrated to Crete from Pelasgiotis;<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> by which is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
meant the same district as that called by Andron
Hestiæotis, since Pelasgiotis and Hestiæotis bordered
on each other in the vicinity of Tempe. Again,
Diodorus affirms that Asterius king of Crete, the
adopted father of Minos, the legislator, was the son
of Tectamus (Teutamus).<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> The essential parts of
these statements are rendered certain by two proofs:
the first of these is, that the worship of Apollo was
practised in Crete with precisely the same ceremonies
as at Tempe, and connected with many of the same
traditions; the second is, the very remote period at
which the principles of the Doric constitution were
systematized and established in Crete, so that they
afterwards became a model and standard for other
states of that race. This gives us the fullest right to
consider Minos of Cnosus as a Dorian. We may
assert, with still more reason, that the name of Minos
indicates a period in which the Doric invaders united
a part of the island into one state, and, by extending
their power over the Cyclades and many maritime districts,
obtained, according to the expression of Herodotus,
Thucydides, and Aristotle, the dominion of the
sea. To discredit this Doric migration would be to
reject the simple explanation of many facts recorded
in later history. At the same time, however, we do
not mean to throw any doubt upon the later migrations
from Peloponnesus, when it had already fallen
under the power of the Dorians.<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> We only assert that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these took place at too late a period to account for
many unquestionable facts. The portion of Crete first
occupied by the Dorians was, according to Staphylus,
the eastern coast;<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> or, to speak more accurately, the
eastern side of the north coast. Here stood the Minoan
town of Cnosus, with its harbour Heracleum and colony
Apollonia. From this point the dominion, customs,
and worship of the Dorians were at a very early period
extended over the districts inhabited by the Eteocretans,
Pelasgians, and Cydonians; and, with the help of later
migrations, pervaded the whole island.<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a> And although
the different dialects could still be distinguished at the
time of Homer,<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> yet in later times the Doric appears to
have been universally adopted.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>

10. We now return to the passage of Herodotus, of
which a part has been already quoted; <span class="tei tei-q">“When however
the Dorians were driven out by the Cadmeans,
they dwelt under Mount Pindus, and were called the
Macednian nation.”</span> In this passage the author alludes
to the legend, that the Cadmeans, being expelled
from Thebes by the Argives, fled to the Encheleans of
Illyria, where they bordered upon Homolè, a Magnesian
mountain near the valley of Tempe. In this
settlement they would certainly be in the neighbourhood
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Dorians. But we should bear in mind how
perplexed is the fable which we have before
us.<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> The
predatory excursion of the Encheleans to Phocis and
Bœotia appears to admit of no doubt, as it was noticed
by a Delphian oracle of tolerable antiquity, and by the
tradition of the Thebans. The same horde may in its
passage have also disturbed the Dorians in their settlements;
but it is no less wonderful, that fugitive Thebans
should have voluntarily taken refuge with the Encheleans
in Illyria, than that this latter nation should have
driven the Dorians from their settlements. It may be
true that some northern hordes expelled the Dorians
from mount Olympus, since at a later period we find
the Pæonian (Teucrian) race of the Pelagones, who
had descended from the Axius,<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> and made themselves
masters of the Tripolis, Azorum, Doliche, and Pythium,
in possession of their ancient settlements.

As to the statement of Herodotus, that the Macednians,

Lydias, from the mountains to the coast),<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> were derived

Doric origin of their royal family, wished to claim
the same honour for the whole nation: but there does
not appear to be any historical foundation for this statement.

were indeed for the most part Greeks, but neither their
language or customs authorize us to consider them as

<span class="tei tei-q">“the race of the Dorians migrated to Dryopis, afterwards

also it will be necessary to give some illustration of
the geography of the country; beginning at Thermopylæ
(the point at which mount Œta comes in

swallowed up in Parnassus, and both ranges are lost

Following the plain of Phocis, which lies between
mounts Œta and Parnassus, and is watered by the
Cephisus, we presently find the mountains approaching
each other from both sides, and contracting the valley
of the river. The last towns of Phocis in this direction
are, Amphicæa, Tithronium and Drymæa, still to be

higher country, we soon arrive at the sources of the
river Cephisus, which cannot be mistaken, since it
immediately forms a stream of considerable size. The
Cephisus indeed rises not in Œta but in Parnassus,
and runs first to the north-east, in order to make a
bend afterwards to the south-east.<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> The situation is
particularly indicated by the ancient citadel of a town,
situated close to the source, upon a steep projection of
Parnassus; this place must be recognised as Lilæa.
The scenery around is of a grand and bold description.
Twenty stadia from hence was situated Charadra, where
a mountain-torrent joined the Cephisus. But the river
Pindus, which falls into the Cephisus not far from
Lilæa, comes down from a much greater elevation.
These valleys, lying to the north-west of Lilæa,<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> constitute
the proper district of Doris, little described in
detail by the ancients, and never till a short time since
visited by modern travellers. The steep citadel, about
an hour and a half's distance from Lilæa, situated
upon a projection of Parnassus near the village of
Mariolatis, is perhaps Bœum. The ancient walls in
the valley towards the west near Stagni must be set

Erineus should probably be sought for in the defiles of Œta, nearer
the sources of the stream just mentioned.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> Near
Œta was situated Acyphas,<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> probably the same as the
city of Pindus<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> above Erineus, and of the same name
as the river; both which names the Dorians had
brought with them from their early settlements. This
corner of land, placed under the chief mountain-chain
of Greece, and hanging over the plains which extend
from thence, was bounded by the upper districts of
Ætolia, by the territory of the Ozolian Locrians,
Phocis, and southern Thessaly.<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> From Cytinium a

by modern travellers. This pass made the small
stronghold of Cytinium so important as a military post,
that Philip of Macedon, when he invaded Northern
Greece before the battle of Chæronea, immediately occupied
Elatea and Cytinium<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a>, evidently as a key to the

western districts. From Delphi another mountain-path
(which was reckoned by an ancient traveller at
180 stadia<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>)
crossed over in the direction of Lilæa.
The modern road to the north, from the valley of
Pindus, likewise goes along a mountain-pass through
the defiles and ravines of Œta, to the opposite side of
the valley of the Spercheus, now called
Hellada.<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> If
this was passable in ancient times, it formed the communication
between Doris and the country of the
Malians.

2. Mount Œta stretches in a westerly direction for
the length of 200 stadia towards the Malian bay, which
it reaches at Thermopylæ. It separates Doris, Phocis,
and the Epicnemidian Locrians from the valley of the
Spercheus. The passes connected with it are, first,
the one just mentioned: secondly, another from Phocis
to the rocky glen of Trachinia;<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> and, lastly, that of
Thermopylæ, together with the upper path, made
famous by the battle with the Persians. The pass of
Thermopylæ is formed on one side by the steep declivity
of the mountain, and on the other by a deep and impassable
salt-marsh: these in the narrowest part are
only 60 paces distant from each other:<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> in the middle
arise the hot sulphurous springs, which gave the name
to the defile. At no great distance from these lies the
little plain of Anthela, breaking into two narrow parts
of the pass. At the northern entrance of the passage
there are still the ruins of a wall, which has perhaps
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
served as a barrier against the invasions of Thessalian,
Persian, and Roman armies. Near this spot the brook
Asopus rises from the side of the mountain. At the
southern end of the pass was the small town of
Alpenus, its whole length being about five miles.
From Thermopylæ the paved and raised military road
leads northward over the Spercheus to Thessaly, southward
by Alpenus, Scarpheia, and Thronium, and from
thence to Elatea, and thus to the land of Phocis.

Although the broken and precipitous form of both
mountain and valley rendered the chain of Œta little
suited for human habitation, yet there was in ancient
times a considerable number of cities reaching in a
line from the Doric Tetrapolis, as far as the sea.
Amphanæa must have been built upon mount Œta, but
in the direction of Trachinia; so that, with a little latitude
of expression, it was considered as in Thessaly.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>

On the other side, upon the slope of the
mountain above the valley of the small streams Melas

3. Having now marked out the topography of this
district by traces, which, although not as clear as could
be wished, are yet perfectly accurate, we will next proceed
to inquire concerning the small native tribes which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at different periods settled in these parts, and particularly
concerning the Dorians themselves. Doris, in
the limited meaning of the term, was the valley of the
river Pindus. Whenever the Doric <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tripolis</span></span> is mentioned,
the three cities meant are Bœum, Cytinium,
and Erineus;<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> which last place, as being the most considerable,
appears to have been also called Dorium:<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a>
but when writers speak of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tetrapolis</span></span>, Acyphas (or
Pindus) is added as a fourth town.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> This is the
country which Dorus the son of Hellen is said to have
inhabited, when he brought together his nation on the

sight of the more ancient settlements of the Doric
race. It appears, however, that the Dorians, whilst
confined within these limits, did not rest content with
the possession of this narrow valley, but occupied
several places along mount Œta, of which Amphanæa
was one.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
towns,—viz., Erineus, Cytinium, Bœum, Lilæum,
Carphæa and Dryope: of which, by Lilæum is meant
the town of Lilæa, by Carphæa probably Tarphe near
Thermopylæ,<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a> and by Dryope the country which had
once belonged to the Dryopians. There was therefore
probably a time when the heights near the sources of
the Cephisus, and a narrow strip of land along mount
Œta, as far as the sea, were in the possession of the
Dorians. Nay this was even partly the case in the
Persian war; for even at that time Doris stretched in
a narrow tongue of land thirty stadia broad, between
the Malians and Phoceans, nearly as far as Thermopylæ:<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a>
Scylax also mentions the Dorians as inhabitants
of the sea-coast.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> This district, however,
near mount Œta is that which the Dryopians had formerly
inhabited (as may be shown from a passage of Herodotus)<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>,
before they were entirely dispossessed by the
Dorians, their neighbours in the Tetrapolis. Thus,
by means of this geographical investigation we have
arrived at an historical event. It seems probable that
the Dorians, having moved by slow degrees from Hestiæotis
to mount Œta, first gained possession of the
furthest extremity of the mountain-valley, and thence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gradually spread towards the coast over the land of
the Dryopians. This race indeed generally did not
press all at once, but passed slowly into districts which
had been seized by some part of them at an earlier
period.<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>

4. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dryopians</span></span> (the fragments of whose history
we here introduce) are an aboriginal nation,
which may be called Pelasgic, since Aristotle and
others assign to them an Arcadian origin.<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a> Their
affinity with the Arcadians is confirmed by the worship
paid by them to Demeter Chthonia, to Cora Melibœa,
and Hades Clymenus: which bore a great resemblance
to those of Phigaleia, Thelpusa, and other towns
in Arcadia.<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a> Their territory bordered upon that of
the Malians, so that they extended into the valley of

in a manner entirely mythical, being connected with
the propagation of the worship of Apollo (which is
intimately allied with the migrations of the Dorians),
and also with the adventures of Hercules; but when
a clue to this method of narration is once discovered,
it will be found to be equally, or perhaps more, instructive,
and to convey much fuller information than
a bare historical narrative. In the present instance,
the Pythian Apollo is represented as the god to whom
the vanquished Dryopians are sent as slaves, and who
despatches them to
Peloponnesus;<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> and Hercules, in
conjunction with the Trachinians, subdues and consecrates
them to Apollo, or assigns to them settlements
in Argolis, but allots their land to the Dorians or
Malians.<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From this tradition we might perhaps infer that
the Dryopians accompanied the Dorians in their
migration to Peloponnesus, and settled there with
them. But the situation of the places belonging to
the Dryopians makes it necessary to seek some other
explanation; for the colonies of this race lie scattered
over so many coasts and islands, that they can only
have been planted by single expeditions over the sea.
In Argolis, for instance, they built Hermione, Asine,
and Eion (Halieis), upon projecting headlands and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
promontories; in Eubœa, Styra and Carystus belonged
to them;<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a> among the islands they had settlements
in Cythnos<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> and perhaps Myconos; they had
also penetrated as far as Ionia and Cyprus.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a> Hence
it must be inferred that the Dryopians, harassed or
dislodged by their neighbours, dispersed in various
directions over the sea. It is, however, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historically</span></em>
certain that a great part of the Dryopians were consecrated
as a subject people to the Pythian Apollo (an
usage of ancient times, of which there are many instances),
and that for a long time they served as such;
for even in the fragmentary history of the destruction
of Crissa (Olymp. 47, 590 B.C.), we find <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Craugallidæ</span></span>
mentioned together with the Crissæans,<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> which was a
name of the Dryopians derived from a fabulous ancestor.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>

5. But the Dorians, though hostile to their neighbours
the Dryopians, were on friendly terms with the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Malians</span></span>. This people dwelt in the valley of the
Spercheus, enclosed on all sides by rocky mountains,
and open only in the direction of the sea; they were
divided into the inhabitants of the coast, the Sacerdotal,
and the Trachinians.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> The second of these classes

Thermopylæ, the third on the rocky declivities of mount
Œta. These are the people who were in such close
alliance with the Dorians, that Diodorus speaks of
Trachis as the mother-town of Lacedæmon.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> The

near the city of Hypata.<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>
In early times they had inhabited the inland parts of
Thessaly, and about the end of the fabulous period they
descended into those settlements, from which in later times they were dislodged
by the Illyrian Athamanes.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a>

on the Delphian oracle, and though they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

that the emigration of the Dorians which conquered
Peloponnesus, was in some way or other connected
with the arrival of the Ænianes in this region. There
was an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ancient enmity</span></em> between the Lacedæmonians

Sparta founded the town of Heraclea in the country of
Trachinia; which would doubtless have caused the revival
of an important Doric power in this part of
Greece, had not the jealousy of the Thessalians and
Dolopians, and even of the Malians themselves, been
awakened at its first establishment.

Thus much concerning the situation of the Dorians
in their settlements near mount Œta. The subject
however is not yet exhausted; for we have still to trace
the origin of the great influence which the establishment
of the Dorians at Lycorea upon Parnassus had on
the religion of Delphi (for that Lycorea was a Doric
town will be made probable hereafter), as well as to
treat of the Amphictyonic league, in the founding of
which a very large share doubtless belonged to the
Dorians: but the discussion of both these points must

1. The most important, and the most fertile in consequences,
of all the migrations of Grecian races, and
which continued even to the latest periods to exert its
influence upon the Greek character, was the expedition
of the Dorians into Peloponnesus. It is however
so completely enveloped in fables, and these were
formed at a very early period in so connected a manner,
that it is useless to examine it in detail, without first
endeavouring to separate the component parts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The traditionary name of this expedition is <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
Return of the descendants of Hercules</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a> Hercules,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the son of Zeus is (even in the Iliad), both by birth and
destiny, the hereditary prince of Tiryns and Mycenæ,
and ruler of the surrounding nations.<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a> But through
some evil chance Eurystheus obtained the precedency,
and the son of Zeus was compelled to serve him.
Nevertheless he is represented as having bequeathed
to his descendants his claims to the dominion of
Peloponnesus, which they afterwards made good in
conjunction with the Dorians; Hercules having also
performed such actions in behalf of this race, that his
descendants were always entitled to the possession of
one-third of the territory. The heroic life of Hercules
was therefore the mythical title, through which the
Dorians were made to appear, not as unjustly invading,
but merely as reconquering, a country which had belonged
to their princes in former times. Hence Hercules
is reported to have made war with some degree
of propriety, and subdued the principal countries of the
Doric race (except his native country Argos), Lacedæmon
and the Messenian Pylus, to have established
the national festival at Olympia, and even to have laid
the foundation of the most distant colonies. To esteem
as real these conquests and settlements, these mythical
forerunners of real history, is incompatible with a clear
view of these matters; and we could scarce seriously
ask even the most credulous, how, at a time when
sieges were in the highest degree tedious, Hercules
could have stormed and taken so many fortresses, surrounded
with almost impregnable walls?<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A severer criticism enjoins us to trace the mythical
narrative to its centre, and attempt to ascertain
whether the sovereign race of the Dorians did really
spring from the early sovereigns of Mycenæ; such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
being not only the epic account, but also the tradition
countenanced in Sparta itself. Tyrtæus said, in his
poem called the Eunomia, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zeus himself gave this
territory</span></span> (Laconia) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to the race of Hercules; united
with whom we</span></span> (the Dorians) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">left the stormy Erineus,
and reached the wide island of Pelops</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a>
And a still more important proof is the reply of king
Cleomenes, mentioned by Herodotus, who, when forbidden
by the priestess in the Acropolis of Athens
to enter the temple, as being a Dorian, answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
am no Dorian, but an Achæan,”</span> referring to his
descent from Hercules.<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a> From this it would appear
that there was amongst the Dorians an Achæan phratria,
to which the kings of Argos, Sparta, and Messenia,
and the founders and rulers of Corinth, Sicyon,
Epidaurus, Ægina, Rhodes, Cos, &amp;c., belonged; and
which, in conjunction with the Dorians, only recovered
by conquest its hereditary rights.<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a>

2. It is certainly hazardous at once to reject an
extensive and connected system of heroic traditions,
for the sake of establishing in its place a conjecture
which sacrifices reports recognised by ages prior to
historical information, and celebrated by the earliest
poets, to a mere theory of historical probability. We
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must, however, recollect that mythical legends present
in general merely the views and opinions of nations on
the origin of their actual condition; these opinions
being at the same time more often directed and determined
by religious and other notions, especially by a
certain feeling of justice, than by real tradition, and
therefore they frequently conceal, rather than express,
historical truth. The following remarks, partly deduced
from inquiries which will follow, may serve
to contrast with each other the characteristics of history
and mythology.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place, if we consider the narrative in
question as a plain historical statement, and consequently
suppose the Heraclidæ to have been expatriated
Achæans, the same supposition must be extended
to the whole tribe of Hylleans. For Hyllus,
the representative of the Hylleans, is called the son
of Hercules; and it was with reference to that tribe
that the third part of the territory was secured to
the descendants of Hercules: hence also Pindar calls
the Dorians universally the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">descendants of Hercules
and Ægimius</span></span>.<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a> In this case, then, the Pamphylians
and Dymanes would alone remain as Dorians proper.
It is, however, by no means probable, that, if the most
distinguished part of the Doric people had been of
Achæan descent, the difference between the language,
religion, and customs of these two races would have
been so strongly and precisely marked.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the second place, everything that is related
concerning the exploits of Hercules in the north of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Greece refers exclusively to the history of the Dorians;
and conversely all the actions of the Doric race
in their earlier settlements are mythically represented
under the person of Hercules. Now this cannot be
accounted for by supposing that there was only a
temporary connexion between this hero and the Doric
race.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly, if we compare as much of the fables concerning
Hercules related below as refers to the Dorians,
with those current among the ancient Argives,
and if we separate in mind the links by which the
epic poets gave them an apparent historical connexion,
we shall find no real resemblance between
the two. The worship of Apollo, which can in almost
every case be shown to have been the real motive
which actuated the Dorians, was wholly foreign to
the Argives. If then an Achæan tribe did arrive
amongst the Dorians, bringing with it the story of
Hercules, or a hero so called, this latter people must
have applied and developed his mythology in a manner
wholly different from those to whom they owed it.
And after all, we should be obliged to suppose that
long before their irruption into Peloponnesus, these
Heraclidæ had been so intermixed with the Dorians,
that their traditions were formed entirely
according to the disposition of that race, since Hercules
in Thessaly is represented as a complete Dorian.
Here, however, we are again at variance with the
fable, which represents the Heraclidæ as having fled
to the Dorians a short time only before their entry into
Peloponnesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we are continually met with contradictions,
and never enabled to obtain a clear view of the
question, unless we assent to the proposition that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hercules, from a very remote period, was both a
Dorian and Peloponnesian hero, and particularly the
hero of the Hyllean tribe, which in the earliest settlements
of the Dorians had probably united itself with
two other small nations, the Heraclidæ being the
hereditary princes of the Doric race. The story of
the Heraclidæ being descended from the Argive Hercules,
who performed the commands of Eurystheus,
was not invented till after Peloponnesus had been introduced
into the tradition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_I_Chapter_III_Section_3" id="Book_I_Chapter_III_Section_3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3. There is hardly any part of the traditional
history of Greece whose real sources are so little
known to us as the expedition of the Heraclidæ.
No one can fail to perceive that it possesses the same
mythical character as the Trojan war; and yet we
are deprived of that which renders the examination
of a mythical narrative so instructive, viz. the traditional
lore scattered in such abundance throughout
the ancient epic poems. This event, however, early
as it was, lay without the range of the epic poetry;
and therefore, whenever circumstances connected with
it were mentioned, they must have been introduced
either accidentally or in reference to some other subject.
In no one large class of epic poems was this
event treated at length, neither by the cyclic poets, nor
the authors of the Νόστοι. In the Ἠοῖαι attributed to
Hesiod, it appears only to have been alluded to in a
few short passages.<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a> Herodotus nevertheless mentions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
poets who related the migration of the Heraclidæ and
Dorians into Laconia.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> Perhaps these belonged to the
class who carried on the mythical fables genealogically,
as Cinæthon the Laconian, and also Asius, who celebrated
the descent of Hercules, and appears, from the
character of his poems, to have also commemorated his
descendants.<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a> Or they may have been the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">historical
poets</span></span>, such as Eumelus the Corinthian, although those
alluded to by Herodotus cannot have composed a
separate poetical history (as the former did of
Corinth); since they would doubtless have followed
the national tradition of Sparta; and this, with respect
to the first princes of the Heraclidæ, differed from the
accounts of all the poets with which Herodotus was
acquainted, and was not the general tradition of
Greece.<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a> And doubtless many such local traditions
were preserved amongst particular nations, concerning
an event which for a long time determined the condition
of Peloponnesus. Thus the Tegeatans<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> celebrated
the combat of Echemus their general with
Hyllus. Whether the early historians collected these
accounts from oral record, or whether they derived
them from the poets above mentioned (although the
latter is more in their manner), cannot be determined;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for there are only extant two fragments of these writers
concerning the Heraclidæ, one of Hecatæus, the other
of Pherecydes, which connect immediately with the
death of Hercules, and therefore do not prove that these
authors wrote any continuous account of the history of
this migration. The early tradition received a fuller
development in the Attic drama; but it was unavoidably
represented in a very partial view. The Heraclidæ
of Æschylus, and the Iolaus of Sophocles might,
like the Heraclidæ of Euripides, have had on the whole
the tendency to celebrate those merits which the
Athenians are made to commend in Herodotus,<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> even
before the battle of Platæa, viz., their good offices towards
the Heraclidæ, at the time when they took
refuge in Attica. The last-named tragedian, in his
Temenidæ, Archelaus, and Cresphontes, went further
into the history of the Doric states, and descended lower
into the historical period, than any poet before his time;
his reason having, perhaps, been, the exhaustion of the
legitimate mythical materials.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> Now these Attic
tragedians manifestly took for their basis the narrative
given by Apollodorus, himself an Athenian, as
may be shown by some particular circumstances.
Perhaps Ephorus rested more upon the earlier poets
and historians, as far as we are acquainted with their
statements; but his narrative, even if it were extant,
could, no more than those of the former, be considered
as proceeding from a critical examination; since, in
the first place, from a total misapprehension of the
character of tradition, he forced everything into history,
and then endeavoured to restore the deficiencies of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
oral narrative by probable reasoning; of the fallaciousness
of which method we will bring forward some
proofs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_I_Chapter_III_Section_4" id="Book_I_Chapter_III_Section_4" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
4. After what has been said, we will forbear to
apologize for merely offering a few remarks on the
origin and meaning of the traditions which concern
the Doric migration, instead of endeavouring to give
a history of that event. And, indeed, we might bring
forward some most marvellous legends, but on that very
account the better fitted to convince every one what is
the nature of the ground on which we stand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Ἠοῖαι attributed to Hesiod, it was stated
that Polycaon the son of Butes, whose name represents
the ancient (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Lelegean) population of Messene,
married Euæchme (Εὐαίχμη, viz. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">celebrated for the
spear</span></span>) the daughter of Hyllus, and grand-daughter of
Hercules. In this simple and unpretending manner
the early tradition conveyed the idea that the Hylleans
and Dorians had, by the power of the spear, made
themselves masters of Messene, and united themselves
with the original inhabitants.<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Laconian village of Abia, there was a temple
of Hercules, which was said to have been built by
Abia the nurse of Glenus, the brother of Hyllus.<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> It
was, therefore, supposed that Hyllus and Glenus themselves
came to Laconia. Pausanias endeavours to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reconcile the local tradition with the received history,
and assumes that Abia had fled hither after the death
of Hyllus; which, however, is inconsistent with the
common account that Peloponnesus was in the hands
of the enemy, and that the battle in which Hyllus
fell was at the Isthmus. We come now to the common
relation of the order of events.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_I_Chapter_III_Section_5" id="Book_I_Chapter_III_Section_5" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
5. According to this account, the Heraclidæ, after
the death of their father, were in Trachis with their
host Ceyx, who generously protected them for a time,
but was afterwards forced, by the threats of Eurystheus,
to refuse them any longer refuge; Ceyx, according to
Hecatæus,<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> was compelled to say to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have not
the power to assist you; withdraw therefore to another
nation;”</span> and upon this they sought an asylum
in Attica. Those early historians, however, who stated
that Hercules died as king in Mycenæ, gave an entirely
different account of this circumstance, viz., that Eurystheus,
after the death of Hercules, expelled his sons,
and again usurped the dominion,<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> and they fled in consequence
to Attica.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At Athens they sat as suppliants at the altar of
Pity, received the protection of Theseus or Demophon,
dwelt in the Tetrapolis,<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> and fought, together
with the Athenians, under the command of Hyllus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Iolaus (to whose prayers the gods had granted a
second youth), at the pass of Sciron, a battle against
Eurystheus; Macaria (probably an entirely symbolical
being, but here the daughter of Hercules)
having previously offered herself as an expiatory sacrifice.
In this action they conquered the Argive
king, whom Alcmene with womanish vengeance put to
death, and whose tomb the Athenians showed before
the temple of the Pallenian Minerva.<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> This is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fable so much celebrated by the tragedians and
orators, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">locus communis</span></span> as it were, which the Athenians
sometimes even mentioned in their decrees,<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a> or
wherever it served to show how poorly the Peloponnesians
had requited their ancient benefactors. What
credit a Lacedæmonian would have given to these
stories, we know not; Pindar certainly knew nothing
of them, for he states that Iolaus had near <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thebes</span></span> received
a momentary renewal of youthful vigour for the
purpose of putting to death Eurystheus, after which he
immediately expired, and was buried by the Thebans
in the family tomb of Amphitryon.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> In this account
Eurystheus is represented as having been conquered in
the neighbourhood of Thebes, and in consequence by a
Theban army. It is not however necessary to esteem
the Athenian tradition as altogether groundless, and
purposely invented: it was probably founded on some
actual event, and afterwards modified and embellished.
The connecting link was without doubt the temple of
Hercules in Attica. It was natural that, if the Athenians
worshipped that hero, they should wish to have
had the merit of protecting his descendants. Hence the
sons of Hercules were said to have dwelt in the Tetrapolis
at Marathon, where was the chief temple of Hercules
in Attica, and in the neighbourhood of which
flowed the fountain Macaria, represented as a daughter
of that hero. It was on this account, as is reported,
that the entire Tetrapolis was during the Peloponnesian
war spared by the Lacedæmonians. Many circumstances,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which will hereafter be brought forward,
seem to show that an union and intercourse subsisted
between the Dorians of Peloponnesus and some of
the northern towns of Attica,<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a>
the foundation of which
appears to have been laid in the times of the Doric
migration, by a settlement of Dorians and Bœotians in
these towns. But this settlement had doubtless, when
those fables were invented, been already lost in the
mass of the Athenian people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. After this battle, won by the aid of the Athenians,
the Heraclidæ are said (and with good reason,
as they were assisted by the Athenians) to have obtained
possession of all Peloponnesus, and to have
ruled undisturbed for one year (or some fixed period);
at the expiration of which, a pestilence (like a tragical
catastrophe) drove them back again to Attica. The
mythologists make use of this time to send Tlepolemus
the Heraclide to Rhodes, in order that he may
arrive there before the Trojan war. Of all this, however,
Pherecydes could have known nothing, as he
relates that Hyllus, having conquered Eurystheus,
went to Thebes,<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a> without subduing Peloponnesus, and
there with the other Heraclidæ formed a settlement
near the gate of Electra, a circumstance which we
shall advert to hereafter.<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a>
In Peloponnesus, however,
according to the traditions chronologically arranged,
Eurystheus was succeeded by the Pelopidæ,
who accordingly appear as the expellers of the legitimate
sovereigns of the race of Perseus.<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a> Whether
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any such circumstance was known to the early poets
is very much to be doubted; but it is at least clear,
that in this case we are not in possession of the real
tradition itself, but of scientific combinations of it.
Against these new sovereigns were directed the expeditions
of the Heraclidæ, of which it is generally stated
that there were three. The account given of them
follows the general idea of an entire dependence of the
Dorians on the Delphian oracle;<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> but the misconception
of its injunctions, which embarrasses and perplexes
the whole question, may, we think, be attributed
entirely to the invention of the Athenians. The
oracle mentioned the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">third fruit</span></span>,
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">narrow passage
by sea</span></span> (στενυγρὰ), as the time and way of the
promised return, which the Athenians falsely interpreted
to mean the third <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">year</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isthmus of
Corinth</span></span>. But the account given in Apollodorus, nearly
falling into Iambic or Trochaic metre, leaves no doubt
that he took his account of the oracle from the Attic
tragedians,<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a> as was remarked above. Deceived by
these predictions, Hyllus forced his way into Peloponnesus
in the third year, and found at the Isthmus
the Arcadians, Ionians, and Achæans of the peninsula
already assembled. In a single combat with Echemus
the son of Aëropus, the prince of Tegea, Hyllus fell,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and was buried in Megara; upon which the Heraclidæ
promised not to renew the attempt for fifty or
one hundred years from that time.<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a> Here every one
will recognise the battle of the Tegeate with the Hyllean
as an ancient tradition. But in the arrangement,
by which it was contrived that the expeditions of the
Heraclidæ should not be placed during the Trojan war
and the youth of Orestes, we do not hesitate to suspect
the industry of ancient systematic mythologists.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. When the Heraclidæ had been once separated
from the Dorians as belonging to a different race, and
Hyllus set down as only the adopted son of the Doric
king, it immediately became a matter of doubt at what
time the junction of the Dorians and Heraclidæ in one
expedition should be fixed. Sometimes the Dorians
are represented as joining the Heraclidæ before the
first, sometimes before the second, sometimes before
the third expedition; by one writer as setting out from
Hestiæotis, and by another from Parnassus.<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> There
were doubtless no real traditional grounds for any one
report; and still less any sufficient to place the name
Hyllus, and the events connected with it, at any fixed
epoch. Hence also Hyllus is at one time called the
contemporary of Atreus, and at another of
Orestes;<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a>
Pamphylus and Dymas are stated to have lived from
the time of Hercules to the conquest of
Peloponnesus.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a>
Nor is there any absurdity in this, inasmuch as they are
the collective names of races which existed throughout
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this whole period. The descendants of Hyllus, however,
are no longer races, but, as it appears, real persons;
viz., his son Cleodæus,<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a> and his grandson
Aristomachus. These names stood at the head of the
genealogy of the Heraclidæ; as, for example, of the
kings of Sparta; and they can hardly have been mere
creations of fancy. From their succession is probably
calculated the celebrated epoch of the expedition of the
Heraclidæ, viz., 80 years after the Trojan war, which
was without doubt determined by the early historians,
since Thucydides was acquainted with it. The Alexandrine
critics generally adopted it, as we know
expressly of Eratosthenes, Crates, and Apollodorus.<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a>
But all that is recounted of the expeditions of these two
princes, however small in amount,<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> cannot have been
acknowledged by those who, like Herodotus, and probably
all the early writers, stated the armistice after the
death of Hyllus as lasting 100 years.<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a>

8. At length Apollo himself opens the eyes of the
Heraclidæ to the meaning of the oracle. It was not
across the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isthmus</span></span>, but
over the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Straits of Rhium</span></span>, that
they were to cross into Peloponnesus, and after the
third <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generation</span></em> had died away. They therefore first
sailed from Naupactus, to the Molycrian promontory
(Antirrhium), and thence to Rhium in Peloponnesus,
which was only five stadia distant.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a> That the Dorians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actually came on that side into Peloponnesus, is a statement
which may be looked on as certain; agreeing (as
it does) with the fact that the countries near the Isthmus
were the last to which the Dorians penetrated.
The name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Naupactus</span></span> implies the existence of ship-building
there in early times;<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> and there was a tradition
that the Heraclidæ passed over on rafts, imitations of
which were afterwards publicly exposed at a festival,
and called Στεμματιαῖα, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">crowned with garlands</span></span>.<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a>
This festival was doubtless the Carnea, since the Carnean
Apollo was worshipped at Sparta under the name
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stemmatias</span></span>. Now it is also stated that the Acarnanian
soothsayer Carnus (who was reported to have
founded the worship of the Carnean Apollo) was killed
at the time of this expedition by Hippotes the son of
Phylas, for which reason the Heraclidæ offered expiatory
sacrifices to his memory.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a> We see from this
that some rites of a peculiar worship of Apollo were
observed at this passage, which were probably for the
most part of an expiatory nature. Now I have shown
elsewhere, that the Carnean or Hyacinthian worship of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Ægidæ originated at Thebes, and prevailed in
Peloponnesus before the arrival of the Dorians, particularly
at Amyclæ:<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> consequently, that prevalent near
the straits of Naupactus might have been another, probably
an Acarnanian<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> branch of the religion of Apollo,
which was afterwards incorporated in the Carnean festival;
a supposition which, if admitted, would enable us
to explain many statements of ancient authors. The
religious rites and festivals are in fact often so intermingled
and confused together, that it is necessary to
trace their component parts to many and distant sources.

9. At their passage from Naupactus the Dorians
stood in great need of the friendship and assistance of
the native races, the Ozolian Locrians and Ætolians.
The Locrians occupied Naupactus in early times;<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> the
Ætolians were their immediate neighbours, and their
powerful city of Calydon was the mistress of the region.
The Locrians are said to have aided the Dorians in
their passage, by deceiving the Peloponnesians with
false beacons;<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> and we shall meet hereafter with traces
of a lasting amity between the Locrians and Sparta.
A most singular, but, doubtless for that very reason, a
most ancient dress, has been given by mythology to the
union of the Dorians and Ætolians. This connexion,
which was indispensable for the passage from Naupactus,
is also found implied in other legends, the general
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
character of tradition being to express the same thing
in various ways. Of these we may mention the marriage
of Hercules with Deianira, the daughter of Œneus
the Calydonian.<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a> At this time the Dorians were ordered
by the oracle to seek a person with three eyes for
a leader. This person they recognised in Oxylus the
Ætolian, who either sat upon a horse, himself having
one eye, or rode upon a one-eyed mule. Difficult as it
is to rest satisfied with this interpretation of the oracle,
so casual a circumstance having no connexion with the
general course of events, yet it appears impossible to
discover the true meaning of the word τριόφθαλμος.<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a>
In all probability this expression for the whole Ætolian
race was only delivered in a mythical shape, and the
sorry explanation was not invented until a late
period.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a>
The family of Oxylus is stated to have come from
Calydon; so that the Ætolians (who in later times
made themselves masters of Elis) appear to have come
for the most part from that place.<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> There existed,
however, an ancient alliance and affinity between the
inhabitants of Elis, the Epeans, and the Ætolians who
dwelt on the farther side of the Corinthian gulf; and
Oxylus himself was said to have originally belonged to
Elis;<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a> hence it does not appear that there was any
actual war between these two states, but only that the
Ætolians were received by the Eleans, and admitted to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the rights of citizenship;<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> and at the same time the
same honours were permitted to the heroes and heroines
of the Ætolians as to their own.<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>

10. The systematised tradition next makes mention
of a battle which took place between the united force
of Peloponnesus, under the command of Tisamenus,
the grandson of Agamemnon, and the sons of Aristomachus;
in which the latter were victorious, and
Peloponnesus fell into their possession. According
as it suits the object of the narrator, this engagement
is either represented to have been both by sea and land,
and to have taken place at the passage,<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> or after the
march through Arcadia. We may fairly suppose that
it was inferred merely on probable grounds that a
battle <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> have been fought by Tisamenus, whom the
tradition represented as prince of the Achæans at the
capture of Ægialea.<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a> Many traditions agree in stating
that the Heraclidæ at that time took the road through
Arcadia; Oxylus is said to have led them by this way,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that they might not be envious of his fertile territory

the brother-in-law of Cypselus king of Arcadia, who
had his royal seat at Basilis, on the Alpheus, in the
country of the Parrhasians.<a id="noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a>

<a name="Book_I_Chapter_III_Section_11" id="Book_I_Chapter_III_Section_11" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
11. Next comes the division of Peloponnesus among
the three brothers Temenus, Cresphontes, and Aristodamus,
or his sons. We have to thank the tragedians
alone for the invention and embellishment of this fable;<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a>
that it contains little or no truth is at once evident; for
it was not till long after this time that the Dorians possessed
the larger part of Peloponnesus;<a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a> and a
division of lands not yet conquered is without example
in Grecian history. At the same time it is related
that, upon the altars whereon the brothers sacrificed to
their grandfather Zeus, there was found a frog for
Argos, a snake for Sparta, and a fox for Messenia.
It seems however probable that these are mere symbols,
by which the inventors (perhaps the hostile Athenians)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attempted to represent the character of those
nations. For it cannot be supposed that national arms
or ensigns are meant; unless indeed we give credit to
the pretended discovery of Fourmont, who affirms that
he found in the temple of the Amyclæan Apollo a
shield with the inscription of Teleclus as general
(βάγος), with a snake in the middle; and another of
Anaxidamus, with a snake and two foxes.<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a> But he
has represented the shield of so extraordinary a form,
with sharp ends, and indentures on the sides, that the
fraud is at once open to detection; and consequently
the supposition that the snake was the armorial bearing
of Sparta remains entirely unfounded.<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. Although we cannot here give a complete account
of the great revolution which the irruption of
the Dorians universally produced in the condition of
the different races of Greece,<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a> it may nevertheless be
remarked, that a very large portion of the Achæans,
who originally came from Phthia, retired to the northern
coast of Peloponnesus, and compelled the Ionians to
pass over to Attica. The reduction of the principal
fortress of this country, the Posidonian Helice, is ascribed
to Tisamenus; and that Helice was in fact the
abode of the most distinguished families of the Achæan
nation is evident from the legend, that Oxylus the
Ætolian, at the command of the oracle, shared the dominion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with Agorius, a Pelopid, who was descended
from Penthilus the son of Orestes, and dwelt at
Helice.<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a>
The chronological difficulty of Oxylus being called
the cotemporary of a grandson of Penthilus is not of
much importance. At Helice was also shown the
tomb of Tisamenus, whose supposed ashes the Spartans
(doubtless with the idea of thus making amends
for the injustice of his expulsion) afterwards brought
to their city, as they also did the corpse of Orestes at
Tegea.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> But hereupon follows a series of
migrations to Æolis in Asia, which was founded in later times, in
which the numbers of the Achæan race predominated.
Although Orestes is called a leader of the first
expedition,<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a>
he probably is only put for his descendants: Penthilus
also is perhaps put only for that part of his
descendants who went with the colony to Lesbos and
Æolis. For all the Penthilidæ did not go; we find
indeed Penthilidæ in Mitylene;<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a> and others at Helice,
as we have just seen. Pisander, a Laconian Achæan,
is also mentioned as having gone with the expedition of
Orestes; and there were men of his family in Tenedos
at the time of Pindar.<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a>

1. So wonderful is the physical organization of
Greece, that each of its parts has received its peculiar
destination and a distinct character; it is like a body
whose members are different in form, but between
which a mutual connexion and dependence necessarily
exists. The northern districts as far as Thessaly are
the nutritive organs which from time to time introduced
fresh and vigorous supplies: as we approach the south,
its structure assumes a more marked and decided form,
and is impressed with more peculiar features. Attica
and the islands may be considered as extremities, which,
as it were, served as the active instruments for the body
of Greece, and by which it was kept in constant connexion
with others; while Peloponnesus, on the
other hand, seems formed for a state of life, occupied
more with its own than external concerns, and whose
interests and feelings centred in itself. As it was the
extremity of Greece, there also appeared to be an end
set by nature to all change of place and habitation; and
hence the character of the Peloponnesians was firm,
steady, and exclusive. With good reason therefore
was the region where these principles predominated considered
by the Greeks as the centre and acropolis<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a>

of their countries; and those who possessed it were
universally acknowledged to rank as first in Greece.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. This character of Peloponnesus will become
more evident, if we examine the peculiar nature of its
mountain-chains. Though the Isthmus of Corinth
connected the peninsula with the continent by a narrow
neck of land, yet it was not traversed in its whole
length by any continuous chain of mountains; the
Œnean hills being entirely separated from the mountains
of Peloponnesus.<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> The principal elevations in
Peloponnesus form very nearly a circle, the circumference
of which passes over the mountains of Pholoë,
Lampe, Aroanius, Cyllene, Artemisium, Parthenium,
and Parnon; then over Boreum, and from thence up
to the northern rise of mount Taygetus, and finally
over mount Lycaon along the river Alpheus. The
highest ridge appears to be that part of Cyllene which
looks to Parnon: the height of Cyllene, according to
the statement of Dicæarchus,<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a> was not quite 15 stadia;
according to another measurement, it was nine stadia
wanting 80 feet;<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a> a considerable height, when it is
remembered that the sea is near, and that Peloponnesus
is the last link of the great chain, which runs down
from the north of Macedonia. But the eastern plains
also, for instance that of Tegea, are at a great height
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
above the sea, and are often covered with snow late in
the spring.<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href="#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a> Now from the circle of mountains which
has been pointed out, all the rivers of any note take
their rise; and from it all the mountainous ranges diverge,
which form the many headlands and points of
Peloponnesus. The interior part of the country however
has only one opening towards the western sea,
through which all its waters flow out united in the
Alpheus. The peculiar character of this inland tract
is also increased by the circumstance of its being intersected
by some lower secondary chains of hills, which
compel the waters of the valleys nearest to the great
chains either to form lakes, or to seek a vent by subterraneous

mountainous district in the north-east of Peloponnesus many
streams disappear, and again emerge from the earth.
This region is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Arcadia</span></span>; a country consisting of
ridges of hills and elevated plains, and of deep and
narrow valleys, with streams flowing through channels
formed by precipitous rocks; a country so manifestly
separated by nature from the rest of Peloponnesus,
that, although not politically united, it was always considered
in the light of a single community. Its
climate was extremely cold; the atmosphere dense,
particularly in the mountains to the north:<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a> the effect
which this had on the character and dispositions of the
inhabitants has been described in a masterly manner by
Polybius, himself a native of Arcadia.

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Laconia</span></span> is formed by two mountain-chains
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
running immediately from Arcadia, and enclosing the
river Eurotas, whose source is separated from that of
an Arcadian stream by a very trifling elevation. The
Eurotas is, for some way below the city of Sparta, a
rapid mountain-stream; then, after forming a cascade,
it stagnates into a morass; but lower down it passes
over a firm soil in a gentle and direct course.<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a> Near
the town of Sparta rocks and hills approach the banks
on both sides, and almost entirely shut in the river both
above and below the town:<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> this enclosed plain is

Here the narrowness of the valley, and the heights of
Taygetus, projecting above in a lofty parapet, increase
the heat of summer, both by concentrating the sun-beams,
as it were, into a focus, and by presenting a
barrier to the cool sea-breezes;<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> whilst in winter the
cold is doubly violent. The same natural circumstances
produce violent storms of rain, and the numerous
mountain-torrents frequently cause inundations
in the narrow valleys.<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a> The mountains, although
running in connected chains, are yet very much interrupted;
their broken and rugged forms were by the
ancients attributed to earthquakes;<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> one of which
caused so great consternation at Sparta a short time
before the war with the Helots. The country is not
however destitute of plains; that indeed along the lower
part of the Eurotas is one of the finest in Greece,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stretching towards the south, and protected by mountains
from the north wind: moreover, the maritime
district, surrounded by rocks, from Malea to Epidaurus
Limera (Malvasia), is extremely fertile.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> Nor are the
valleys on the frontiers of Messenia less productive;
towards the promontory of Tænarum however the soil
continually becomes harder, drier, and more ferruginous.
The error of supposing that this country was
nearly a desert appears from the very large number of
its vegetable productions mentioned by Theophrastus
and others: Alcman and Theognis also celebrate its
wines: vines were planted up to the very summit of
mount Taygetus, and laboriously watered from fountains
in forests of plane-trees;<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a> the country was in this
respect able to provide for its own wants. But the
most valuable product, in the estimation of the new inhabitants, was
doubtless the iron of the mountains.<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a>
More fortunate still was the situation of the country
for purposes of defence, the interior of Laconia being
only accessible from Arcadia, Argolis, and Messenia
by narrow passes and mountain-roads; and the most
fertile part is the least exposed to the inroads of enemies
from those quarters: the want of harbours<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> likewise
contributes to the natural isolation of Laconia
from other lands. Euripides has on the whole very
successfully seized the peculiar character of the country
in the following lines, and contrasted it with the more
favoured territory of Messenia:<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a>

For along the banks of the Pamisus (which, notwithstanding
the shortness of its course, is one of the
broadest rivers in Peloponnesus), down to the Messenian
bay, there runs a large and beautiful valley, justly
called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macaria</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-q">“The Happy,”</span> and well worth the
artifice by which Cresphontes is said to have obtained
it. To the north, more in the direction of Arcadia,
lies the plain of Stenyclarus, surrounded by a hilly
barrier. The western part of the country is more
mountainous, though without any such heights as
mount Taygetus; towards the river Neda, on the
frontiers of Arcadia, the country assumes a character
of the wildest and most romantic beauty.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Argolis</span></span> is formed by a ridge of hills which
branches from Mount Cyllene and Parthenium in
Arcadia, and is connected with it by a mountain-chain,
very much broken, and abounding in ravines and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
caverns (hence called Τρητὸν);<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> through which runs

between walls of rock, connecting Argos with Corinth.
By similar passes Cleonæ, Nemea, and Phlius, more
to the south, and eastwards Mycenæ, Tiryns, and
Epidaurus, were connected; and this natural division
into many small districts had a considerable effect
upon the political state of Argos. The southern part
of this chain ends in a plain, at the opening of which,
and near the pass just alluded to, was situated Mycenæ,
and in a wider part of it the city of Argos. The
nature of this anciently cultivated plain is very remarkable;
it was, as is evident, gradually formed
by the torrents which constantly filled up the bay
between the mountains; and hence it was originally
little else than fen and morass.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> Inachus, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the

damp valley</span></span>”</span> (where ash-trees, μελίαι, grow), were
called the parents of the ancient Argives; and
the epithet <span class="tei tei-q">“thirsty”</span> (πολυδίψιον Ἄργος), which is
applied to Argos in ancient poems, refers only to the
scarcity of spring-water in the neighbourhood of the
town. Yet, notwithstanding the rugged nature of the
rest of Argolis, there are, both in the interior and near
the sea, here and there, small plains, which by the
fertility of their soil attract and encourage the husbandman;
the south-eastern coast slopes regularly
down to the sea. To the north of the mountain-ridge
which bounded Argolis, extending from the Isthmus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as far as a narrow pass on the boundaries of Achaia,
there is a beautiful, and in ancient times highly-celebrated
plain, in which Corinth and Sicyon were
situated.<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a> With respect to the progress of civilization
at Argos, it is important to know that the mountains
between that town and Corinth contain copper:<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> accordingly,
in the former town the forging of metals
appears to have been early introduced; and hence arose
the ancient celebrity of the Argive shields.<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> But
no precious metal has been ever found in any part of
Peloponnesus: a circumstance which greatly tended
to direct the attention of its inhabitants to agriculture
and war, rather than commerce and manufactures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. That region which was in later times called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Achaia</span></span>, is only a narrow tract of land along the
coast, lying upon the slope of the northern mountain-range
of Arcadia. Hence most of the Achæan cities
are situated on hills above the sea, and some few in
enclosed valleys. The sources of the numerous
streams by which the country is watered lie almost
without exception in Arcadia, whose frontiers here
reach beyond the water-line.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the lowest slope of Peloponnesus, and the most
gradual inclination to the sea, is on the western side;
and it is in this quarter that we find the largest extent
of champaign country in the peninsula, which, being
surrounded by the chain beginning from mounts Scollis
and Pholoë, was hence called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hollow Elis</span></span>.
It was a most happy circumstance that these wide
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
plains enjoyed an almost uninterrupted state of peace.
Towards the coast the soil becomes sandy; a broad
line of sand stretches along the sea nearly as far as
the Triphylian Pylos, which from this circumstance is so frequently spoken of by
Homer as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the sandy</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a>
As this tract of country is very little raised above the
level of the sea, a number of small lakes or lagoons
have been formed, which extend along the greatest
part of the coast, and are sometimes connected with
one another, sometimes with the sea. Such being the
nature of the country, the river Alpheus runs gently
between low chains of hills and through small valleys
into the sea. Towards the south the country becomes
more mountainous, and approaches more to the character
of Arcadia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. If now we picture to ourselves this singular
country before the improvements of art and agriculture,
it presents to the mind a very extraordinary
appearance. The waters of Arcadia are evidently
more calculated to fill up the deep ravines and hollows
of that country, or to produce irregular inundations,
than to fertilise the soil by quiet and gentle streams.
The valleys of Stymphalus, Pheneus, Orchomenus,
and Caphyæ in Arcadia required canals, dams, &amp;c.,
before they could be used for the purposes of husbandry.
One part of the plain of Argos was carefully
drained, in order to prevent it becoming a part of the
marshes of Lerna. In the lower part of the course
of the Eurotas it was necessary to use some artificial
means for confining the river: and that this care was
at some time bestowed on it, is evident from the remains
of quays,<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a> which give to the river the appearance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of a canal. The ancient Nestorian Pylus was
situated on a river (Anigrus), which even now, when
it overflows, makes the country a very unhealthy place
of residence; and no traveller can pass a night at
Lerna without danger. Thus in many parts of Peloponnesus
it was necessary, not merely for the use of
the soil, but even for the sake of health and safety,
to regulate nature by the exertions of art. At the
present time, from the inactivity of the natives, the
inevitable consequence of oppression, so bad an atmosphere
prevails in some parts of the country, that,
instead of producing, as formerly, a vigorous and
healthy race, one sickly generation follows another
to the grave. And that improvements of this kind
were begun in the earliest periods, is evident from
the fact, that the traces of primitive cities are discovered
in those very valleys which had most need
of human labour.<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> This induction is also confirmed
by the evidence of many traditions. The scanty accounts
respecting the earliest times of Sparta relate,
that Myles, the son of the earth-born Lelex, built
mills, and ground corn at Alesiæ; and that he had
a son named Eurotas, who conducted the water stagnating
in the level plain into the sea by a canal, which
was afterwards called by his name.<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a> Indeed the situation
of Sparta seems to imply that the standing water
was first drained off:<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a> nay, even in later times, it was
possible, by stopping the course of the river, to lay
most of the country between Sparta and the opposite
heights under water.<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The consideration of these natural circumstances
and traditions obliges us to suppose that the races which
were looked on as the ancient inhabitants of Peloponnesus
(the Pelasgians in the east and north, and the
Leleges in the south and west) were the first who
brought the land to that state of cultivation in which it
afterwards remained in this and other parts of Greece.
And perhaps it was these two nations alone to whom
the care of husbandry, cattle, and everything connected
with the products of the soil, belonged through all
times and changes. For, in the first place, the
numbers of the invading Achæans, Ionians, and afterwards
of the Dorians, were very inconsiderable, as compared
with the whole population of Peloponnesus; and,
secondly, these races conquered the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">people</span></em> as well as
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">country</span></em>, and enjoyed an independent and easy life
by retaining both in their possession: so that, whatever
tribe might obtain the sovereign power, the former
nations always constituted the mass of the population.
By means of these usurpations agriculture was kept in
a constant state of dependence and obscurity, so that
we seldom hear of the improvement of the country,
which is a necessary part of the husbandman's business.
Agriculture was, however, always followed with great
energy and success. For in the time of the Peloponnesian
war, when the population of Peloponnesus must
have been very great, it produced more corn than it
consumed, and there was a constant export from
Laconia and Arcadia downwards to the coast of
Corinth.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. It is not with a view of founding any calculation
upon them, but merely of giving a general idea of the
numerical force of a Greek tribe (which many would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suppose to be a large nation), that I offer the following
remarks. At the flourishing period of the Doric
power, about the time of the Persian war, Sparta,
which had then conquered Messenia, contained 8000
families, Argos above 6000; while in Sicyon, Corinth,
Phlius, Epidaurus, and Ægina, the Dorians were not
so numerous, the constitution being even more oligarchical
in those states. Although in the colonies,
where they were less confined by want of sufficient
space, and by the severity of the laws, the inhabitants
multiplied very rapidly, yet the number of original
colonists, as many of them as were Dorians, was very
small. Now since in the states of Peloponnesus, even
after they had been firmly established, the number of
inhabitants, particularly of Dorians, never, from several
causes, much increased,<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> it seems probable that
at the time of their first irruption the whole number of
their males was not above 20,000.<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> Nor were the
earlier settlements of Achæans and Ionians more considerable.
For the Ionians, as is evident from their
traditions, appear as a military race in Attica, and probably
formed, though perhaps together with many
families of a different origin, one, and certainly the
least, of four tribes (the ὅπλητες<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a>). The arrival of the
Achæans is represented in ancient traditions in the following
simple manner: <span class="tei tei-q">“Archander and Architeles,
the sons of Achæus, having been driven from Phthiotis,
came to Argos and Lacedæmon.”</span><a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a> Their
names signify <span class="tei tei-q">“the ruler,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the chief governor.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Certainly the Achæans did not come to till the ground;
as is also evident from the fact that, when dislodged by
the Dorians, and driven to the northern coast, they
took possession of Patræ, dwelt only in the town, and
did not disperse themselves into the smaller villages.<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems pretty certain that the Dorians migrated
together with their wives and children. The Spartans
would not have bestowed so much attention as they did
on women of a different race; and all the domestic
institutions of the Dorians would have been formed in
a manner very unlike that which really obtained. This
circumstance alone completely distinguishes the migration
of the Dorians from that of the Ionians, who
having, according to Herodotus, sailed from Attica
without any women, took native Carian women for
wives, or rather for slaves, who, according to the same
writer, did not even dare to address their husbands by
their proper names. And this was probably the case
with all the early settlements beyond the sea, since the
form of the ancient Greek galley hardly admitted of
the transport of women.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. It would have been less difficult to explain by
what superiority the Dorians conquered Peloponnesus,
had they gained it in open battle. For, since it appears,
that Homer describes the mode of combat in use among
the ancient Achæans, the method of fighting with lines
of heavy armed men, drawn up in close and regular
order, must have been introduced into Peloponnesus by
the Dorians; amongst whom Tyrtæus describes it as
established. And it is evident that the chariots and
darts of the Homeric heroes could never have prevailed
against the charge of a deep and compact body armed
with long lances. But it is more difficult still to comprehend
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
how the Dorians could have entered those
inaccessible fortifications, of which Peloponnesus was
full; since their nation never was skilful in the art of
besieging, and main force was here of no avail. How,
I ask, did they storm the citadel of Acro-Corinthus,
that Gibraltar of Peloponnesus?<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> how the Argive
Larissa, and similar fortresses? On these points, however,
some accounts have been preserved with regard
to the conquest of Argos and Corinth, which, from
their agreement with each other, and with the circumstances
of the places, must pass as credible historical
memorials. From these we learn that the Dorians
always endeavoured to fortify some post at a short
distance from the ancient stronghold; and from thence
ravaged the country by constant incursions, and, kept
up this system of vexation and petty attack, until the
defenders either hazarded a battle, or surrendered their
city. Thus at a late period the places were still shown
from whence Temenus and Aletes had carried on contests
of this nature with success.<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a> And even in historical
times this mode of waging war in an enemy's
country (called ἐπιτειχισμὸς τῃ χώρᾳ) was not unfrequently
employed against places, which could not be
directly attacked.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>

1. Before the time of the Dorians, Mycenæ, situated
in the higher part of the plain at the extremity
of the mountain-chain, had doubtless been the most
important and distinguished place in Argolis; and
Argos, although the seat of the earliest civilization
was dependent upon and inferior to it. At Mycenæ
were the Cyclopian hall of Eurystheus,<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> and the sumptuous
palace of Agamemnon; and though, as Thucydides
correctly says, the fortified town was of inconsiderable
extent, yet it abounded with stupendous and
richly-carved monuments, whose semi-barbarous but
artificial splendour formed a striking contrast with the
unornamented and simple style introduced after the
Doric period.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> The Doric conquerors, on the other
hand, did not commence their operations upon fortresses
secured alike by nature and art, but advanced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into the interior from the coast. For near the sea
between Lerna and Nauplia, on the mouth of the
Phrixus,<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a> there was a fortified place named Temenium,
from which Temenus the son of Aristomachus, together
with the Dorians, carried on a war with Tisamenus
and the Achæans, and probably harassed them
by repeated incursions, until they were obliged to
hazard an open battle. From thence the Dorians,
after severe struggles, made themselves masters of the
town of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Argos</span></span>.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> It is related in an isolated tradition,
that Ergiæus, a descendant of Diomed, stole and gave
to Temenus the Palladium brought by his ancestor
from Troy to Argos, which immediately occasioned the
surrender of the city.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a> Argos was therefore supposed
to have been taken by Temenus himself.

<a name="Book_I_Chapter_V_Section_2" id="Book_I_Chapter_V_Section_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. The further extension of the Doric power is,
however, attributed not to Temenus, but to his sons;
for such the Doric tradition calls Ceisus, Cerynes,
Phalces, and Agræus or Agæus.<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> Of these, Ceisus
is represented to have governed at Argos, and Phalces
to have gone to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sicyon</span></span>. The ancient Meconè or
Sicyon had in early times been in the power of the
Ionians, and afterwards subject to the Achæans of
Argos. The very copious mythology of this ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
city contains symbolical and historical elements of
the most various nature: we will only touch upon a
part of the story immediately preceding the Doric
invasion. Phæstus, a son of Hercules, is stated to
have been king of Argos before that event; and having
gone to Crete, where he founded the town of his
name,<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> to have been succeeded by his descendants
Rhopalus, Hippolytus, and Lacestades, the last of
whom lived on terms of friendship with Phalces.
Between them, however, Zeuxippus, a son of Apollo
and of the nymph Hyllis,<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a> is placed. We here perceive
the traces of a connexion between Phæstus in Crete,
and the introduction of the worship of Apollo and
Hercules; this tradition, however, cannot authorise us
to draw any chronological inferences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_I_Chapter_V_Section_3" id="Book_I_Chapter_V_Section_3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3. Whether <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phlius</span></span> (situated in a corner of Arcadia,
in a beautiful valley, whence arise the four
sources of the Asopus<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a>) was founded from Sicyon or
Argos, was a matter of contention between these two towns: the
latter simply called Phlias the son of Ceisus.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>
This <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phlias</span></span>, however, is nothing else than the country
personified; the name being derived from φλέω or
φλιδάω, and signifying <span class="tei tei-q">“damp,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“abounding in
springs,”</span> which appellation was fully merited by the
nature of the spot. Hence Phlias was with more reason
called the son of Dionysus (Φλεὺς, Φλεὼν), who loved
to dwell in such valleys. There is, therefore, greater
probability in the account of the Sicyonians, that
Phalces and Rhegnidas were the founders of the Doric
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dominion;<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> it being moreover easier to force a way to
Phliasia from Sicyon along the Asopus, than from
Argos. It is known, that Pythagoras the Samian
derived his origin from a certain Hippasus, who had
quitted Phlius on that occasion; and the Ionic town
of Clazomenæ is said to have been partly founded by
some inhabitants of Cleonæ and Phliasia, who had been expelled by
the Dorians;<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a> from which two facts
we are justified in inferring the existence of a connexion
between the early inhabitants of these places
and the Ionians. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cleonæ</span></span>, situated in a narrow
valley, where the mountains open towards Corinth, and
bordering upon Phlius, appears from this account to
have been colonised at the same time with that town,
but probably from Argos. For we find that the ruling
power was there in the hands of the same Heraclide
family, of which a branch went from Argos to
Epidaurus.<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a>

4. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Acte</span></span> (as the northern coast of Argolis,
over against Attica, was called)<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> was reduced, according
to the account of Ephorus, by Deiphontes and
Agæus.<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a> The former of these, who was called a descendant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Ctesippus, and son-in-law of Temenus,
and whose fortunes afforded materials for the tragic
poets, made himself master of the town of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epidaurus</span></span>,
and dislodged the Ionians from thence: these latter,
under the command of their king Pityreus, crossed
over to Attica, whence the king's son Procles went
subsequently, at the general Ionic migration, to Samos.<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a>
Of the Dorians of Epidaurus, however, a part under
the conduct of Triacon withdrew to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ægina</span></span>,<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> in which
place Hellenes of Thessaly had formerly ruled, and
united the island and mother-state into one commonwealth,
with equal rights, and the same magistrates.
Now since besides Epidaurus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Trœzen</span></span> alone belonged
to the Actè, and since both Agæus and Deiphontes are
mentioned as the Dorian colonisers of this coast, it was
probably this Agæus who brought Trœzen under the
rule of the Dorians.<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>
In this city, too, he must have
encountered some Ionians; since both the mythical
genealogies and religious rites of the ancient Trœzen
attest a close connexion between its earlier inhabitants
and the
Athenians.<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> For Trœzen even shared with the
Ionic cities in the peculiar worship of the Apaturian
Athene, as the goddess of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">phratriæ</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gentes</span></span>;<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> as
also in that of Poseidon and his son Theseus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_I_Chapter_V_Section_5" id="Book_I_Chapter_V_Section_5" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
5. The accounts already given show that Sicyon,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Phlius, Cleonæ, Epidaurus, Trœzen, and Ægina received
their share of Doric inhabitants either mediately
or immediately from Argos. We can only regret the
want of any accurate accounts respecting Mycenæ and
Tiryns; the conquest of which cities must have been
most difficult; but, when accomplished, decisive for
the sovereignty of the Dorians. Pindar<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a> considers
the expulsion of the Achæan Danai from the gulf of Argos,
and from Mycenæ, as identical with the expedition of
the Heraclidæ; and Strabo states that the Argives
united Mycenæ with themselves.<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a>
Nevertheless we find that in the Persian war Mycenæ and Tiryns were
still independent states, and it admits of a doubt whether
they had previously belonged for any length of time to
Argos. That some ancient inhabitants at least still
maintained themselves in the mountains above Argos,
is shown by the instance of the Orneatæ. The inhabitants
of Orneæ, a town on the mountainous frontier
of Mantinea, having long been hostile to the Dorians,
and at war with the Sicyonians,<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> were at length overpowered
by Argos, and degraded to the state of
periœci.<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a>
Now, since it is more probable that such a
proceeding took place against the people of a different
race, than against a colony of Argos, and also as there
is nowhere any mention of a Doric settlement at Orneæ,
it is evident that the inhabitants of Orneæ had up to
that time been either Achæans or Arcadians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Although from the foregoing accounts it appears
that Argos almost entirely lost its power over the towns
which it had been the means of bringing under the rule
of the Dorians, yet in early times there existed certain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
obligations on the part of these cities towards Argos,
which at a later period became mere forms. There was
in Argos, upon the Larissa, a temple of Apollo Pythaëus,
which had probably been erected soon after the
invasion of the Dorians, as a sanctuary of the national
deity who had led them into the country. It was a
temple common to all the surrounding district, though
belonging more particularly to the Argives.<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a> The
Epidaurians were bound at certain seasons to send
sacrifices to it.<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> The Dryopians in early times, and
afterwards also, in their character of Craugallidæ, or
servants of the Delphian god, had at Asine and Hermione
erected temples to Apollo Pythaëus, in acknowledgment
of a similar dependence; and this was the
only one spared by the Argives at the destruction of
the former town.<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The fragments preserved respecting the ancient
history of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dryopians</span></span> having been collected in a
previous chapter,<a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a>
we shall here only remark that this
people possessed a considerable district in the most
southern part of Argolis, the boundaries of which, so
long as they remained inviolate, were defined by two
points, viz. the temple of Demeter Thermesia on the
frontier between Hermione and Trœzen, eighty stadia
from Cape Scyllæum, and a hill between Asine, Epidaurus,
and Trœzen,<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a> and they may still be
pointed out with tolerable certainty. Hercules, who, according to
the Doric tradition, brought the Dryopians hither, had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accurately marked out these boundaries. It is, however,
also related that the Dryopians established themselves
beyond these limits at Nemea<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> in Argolis: this,
however, as well as Olympia, was not any particular
town, but merely the name of a valley, and particularly
of a temple of Zeus there situated.

8. The history of the establishment of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Corinth</span></span>,
though marvellous and obscure, contains nevertheless
some historical traces by no means unworthy of remark.
In the first place, it is stated that this town did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>
receive its inhabitants from Argos. The purport of
the tradition is as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“When Hippotes at the
time of the passage of the Dorians from Naupactus
slew the soothsayer, he was banished (according to
Apollodorus for ten years),<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href="#note_316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> during which time he
led a roaming and predatory life;”</span><a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> whence his son
was called Ἀλήτης, or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wanderer</span></span>.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> It is also
recorded in the fragment of a tradition<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> that Hippotes,
when crossing the Melian gulf, imprecated against
those who wished to remain behind, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That their vessels
might be leaky, and themselves the slaves of their
wives.</span></span>”</span> In like manner his son Aletes passed through
the territory at that time called Ephyra, where he received
from scorn a clod of earth;<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> which in the ancient oracular language was a
symbol of sovereignty.<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
We might almost guess from these traditions that the
Dorian warriors had harassed, and at length subdued
the ancient Ephyreans, by ravaging their lands, and
by repeated invasions. This is confirmed by the very credible
account of Thucydides relating to this point.<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a>
There was in the mountainous country, about sixty
stadia from Corinth, and twelve from the Saronic gulf,
a hill called Solygius, of which the Dorians had once
taken possession for the purpose of making war against
the Æolian inhabitants of Corinth. This hill was, however
(at least in the time of Thucydides), entirely
unfortified. Here we may recognise the very same
method of waging war as in the account of Temenus
given above, a method which in the Peloponnesian war
was adopted by the Spartans at the fortifying of
Decelea. Again, it is related in a tradition connected
with the Hellotian festival, that at the taking of Corinth
the Dorians set fire to the town, and even to the temple
of Athene, in which the women had taken refuge.<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a>
In another it is stated that Aletes, being advised by an
oracle to attack the city on a <span class="tei tei-q">“crowned day,”</span> took it
during a great funeral solemnity by the treachery of
the youngest daughter of Creon: these, however, are
for the most part mere attempts at an historical interpretation
of ancient festival ceremonies. As Aletes
(according to his genealogy) lived one generation after
the conquerors of Peloponnesus, the capture of Corinth
was dated thirty years after the expedition of the
Heraclidæ;<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a> whence probably also arose the error of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supposing that there had previously been Dorians at
Corinth; as it was supposed that the Dorians had
obtained their whole dominion over Peloponnesus at
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> time, by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> expedition. The city appears to have
received the name of Corinth at this time, instead of
its former one of Ephyra;<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> and it
seems that the Dorians called it with a certain preference <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
Corinth of Zeus</span></span>;”</span> although ancient interpreters have
in vain laboured to give a satisfactory explanation
of this name.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. The early inhabitants of Corinth were, according
to the expression of Thucydides,<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> Æolians; and their
traditions and religion show that they were very nearly connected with the
Minyans of Iolcus and Orchomenus.<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a>
Their kings were the Sisyphidæ, whose
genealogy closes with Hyantidas and Doridas. We
find in the last name the same confusion which has been
pointed out (amongst others) in the legend of Thessalus
the son of Jason,<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> viz., that the arrival of a different
nation was expressed by connecting the new
comers genealogically with the heroes of the ruling
race. Thus Doridas, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the Dorians in a patronymic
form, is the descendant of Sisyphus. Here begins the
sovereignty of the Dorians; who, however, did not, as
Pausanias<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>
states, altogether expel the ancient inhabitants,
but formed the aristocratic class of the new
state. Pindar and Callimachus, indeed, call the whole
Corinthian nation <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aletiadæ</span></span><a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> but merely by a poetical
license; the only lineal descendants of Aletes being the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ruling house, the Bacchiadæ, from which for a long
time were taken the kings and Prytanes of Corinth
and all its colonies. There were, however, at Corinth
distinguished families of a different origin. The family
of Cypselus, which afterwards obtained possession
of the tyranny, was, according to Herodotus, of the
blood of the Lapithæ, and descended from
Cæneus.<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a>
They came, according to Pausanias, from Gonusa,
near Sicyon, to assist the Dorians against Corinth:<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a>
Aletes, however, at the advice of an oracle, at first
refused to receive them, but presently admitted them
into the city, where they afterwards overthrew his own
descendants. We shall allow this narrative, which
contains a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">post eventum</span></span> prophecy of the tyranny of
the Cypselidæ, to rest on its own merits, remarking
only that the Cænidæ had more reason to assist the
ancient Æolians than the Dorians; and shall merely
infer from it the existence of distinguished families in
Corinth not of Doric descent.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. As in this chapter we have hitherto rather followed
a geographical than a chronological arrangement,
we will now pass to the founding of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Megara</span></span>.<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a>
That event is represented by the ancient tradition as
connected with the expedition of the Peloponnesians
against Athens;<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a> which is doubtless a correct statement,
since Megara had before that epoch been closely
united with Attica, and comprehended in Ionia. This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
expedition was, according to most authors, undertaken
by the whole Peloponnesus; by some, however, the
Corinthians are called the real authors of it, and Aletes
the leader, Althæmenes of Argos, the son of Ceisus,
being nevertheless joined with him. The defeat of
the Doric invaders, by the voluntary sacrifice of Codrus,
has been a favourite subject both with poets and
rhetoricians.<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a>
It is sufficient for our purpose to oppose
to this celebrated legend an obscure tradition that some
Athenians, whom Lycophron calls Codri, had a share
in the expedition of the Heraclidæ.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a> Whether or not
the Ionians and Dorians met at the borders on this
occasion, thus much is certain, that Megara in consequence
of this invasion became a Doric town, and
indeed soon afterwards a Corinthian colony.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href="#note_337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a> It also
remained for some time in complete dependence on
Corinth, as Ægina upon Epidaurus; in proof of
which it is mentioned that the Megarians were bound
to mourn for every death that occurred in the family
of the Bacchiadæ at Corinth.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> When, however, the
internal strength of Megara increased, it ventured to
dissolve this connexion, and, in defiance of the Corinth
of Zeus, to rout the Corinthians in the field.<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
border-wars of the Megarians and Corinthians were
carried on without intermission.<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a> Megara appears not
to have raised itself to the situation of a ruling city till
after it had obtained its independence; since in earlier
times it had been one of the five hamlets (κῶμαι) into
which the country was divided, viz. the Heræans,
Piræans, Megarians, Cynosyrians, and Tripodiscians.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a>
These small communities also waged war with each
other, but with a singular lenity, of which some almost
marvellous accounts have been preserved; the conquerors
carried their prisoners home, treated them as
guests and companions, who were hence called δορύξενοι,
in opposition to δορυάλωτοι.

11. We now turn to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Laconia</span></span>, which, according
to the above-mentioned legend concerning the division
of Peloponnesus, fell to the share of Aristodemus or
his sons.<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> According to the common tradition (which

after the death of their father; whereas the national
tradition of Sparta, as Herodotus informs us, represented
Aristodemus himself as having been the first
ruler,<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a> and the double dominion of his children as not

however, enjoying a certain degree of precedence.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a> This is, indeed,
contradicted by the account of Thucydides,<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a>
who mentions as a Lacedæmonian tradition,
that the kings who first took possession of Lacedæmon
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Eurysthenes and Procles) were conducted thither
with dances and sacrifices, an honour which at the
command of the Delphian oracle was afterwards given
to Pleistoanax at his restoration. This variation, however,
is perhaps merely the effect of a pardonable
negligence in the author.

<a name="Book_I_Chapter_V_Section_12" id="Book_I_Chapter_V_Section_12" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
12. It is, however, far more difficult to ascertain
what was the condition of Laconia immediately after
the invasion of the Dorians. For it is plain that the
history, as it was arranged by Ephorus, and derived
from him to other authors, is in contradiction with
many isolated traditions, but which for that very
reason are of the greater importance. So far, indeed,
from the whole of the Laconian territory immediately
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
falling into the hands of the Dorians,<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> it is certain that
a powerful fortress of the ancient Achæans, at a short
distance from Sparta itself, held out for nearly three
centuries after the Doric invasion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a saying, well known in antiquity, of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“silent Amyclæ;”</span> thus called because its citizens had
been so often alarmed by the report of the enemy
coming, that they at last made a law that no one should
give tidings of the enemy's approach; in consequence
of which the town was at length taken.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> This proverb,
and the story on which it was founded, prove the
existence of a long and determined contest between the
two neighbouring cities. They also confirm the account
of Pausanias, that the Dorians in the reign of
Teleclus built a temple<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> to Zeus Tropæus, because
they had at length, after a tedious and severe struggle,
overcome the Achæans of Amyclæ and taken their
city. This city of Amyclæ, one of the most ancient
and considerable in Peloponnesus, of which there still
remains a fort situated upon a rock on the side of
mount Taygetus, was therefore so far from being reduced
by the Spartans immediately, that it held out
until the reign of Teleclus, 278 years after the invasion,
a short time before the first Messenian war; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then was only taken after a tedious contest, which,
from the proximity of Amyclæ and Sparta, must have
been very dangerous to the latter city. Now it is not
possible that before this victory Amyclæ and Sparta,
distant only 20 stadia (2-1/2 miles) from each other,
should have been engaged in constant war, as it must
have soon ended in the destruction of one or the other
city: their truces and armistices were, however, doubtless
interrupted frequently by sudden incursions. The
important territory near mount Taygetus belonged at
that time to Amyclæ, and all this country was still
in the possession of the Achæans, with whom some
Minyans from Lemnos, and Cadmean Greeks, known
by the name of Ægidæ, had united themselves. This
is the territory from which the colonies of Thera,
Melos, and Gortyna proceeded; so, according to
Pindar, Amyclæ was the point from which the first
colonies to Lesbos and Tenedos set out, and also (as
may be inferred from other notices) those Achæans
who took possession of Patræ.<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sparta, on the other hand, must have been of very
slight importance before the Doric migration; by
which event alone it was enabled to become the ruler
of all the surrounding states. For, in the first place,
Sparta was not built in the same manner as Mycenæ,
Tiryns, and other ruling cities founded before the Doric
invasion; the Acropolis is a hill of inconsiderable
height, and easy of ascent, without any trace of ancient
fortifications or walls. Secondly, it is remarkably
deficient in monuments and local memorials of the
times of the Pelopidæ and other mythical princes;
much as the Spartans in other instances clung to traditions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and records of this kind: while Amyclæ and
Therapne had these in great abundance. Amyclæ, in a beautiful and
well-wooded country,<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a> was the abode of
Tyndareus and his family; here were the tombs of
Cassandra and Agamemnon, who, according to a native tradition
(preserved by Stesichorus and Simonides),<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a>
ruled in this city. At no great distance was situated
the town of Therapne. Alcman calls it the <span class="tei tei-q">“well-fortified
Therapne;”</span><a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a> Pindar mentions its high situation;<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a>
by which they clearly imply a position and fortification
similar to that of Tiryns. The latter also
calls it the ancient metropolis of the Achæans, amongst
whom the Dioscuri lived; here were the subterraneous
cemeteries of Castor and Pollux,<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> vaulted, perhaps,
in the ancient manner; here also the temples of
the Brothers and of Helen in the Phœbæum, and
many remains of the ancient symbolical religion.<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a> It
is also very remarkable, that on the banks of the
Eurotas, in the district between Therapne and Amyclæ,
there should have been discovered a building<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href="#note_358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> which
resembles the well-known treasury at Mycenæ, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which affords a certain proof that the dominion of the
Pelopidæ extended to this district.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although the local traditions make it probable
that the ante-Doric rulers of the country dwelt in
Amyclæ and Therapne, yet Homer describes Sparta
as the residence of the Pelopidæ, transferring, apparently,
the circumstances of his own time to an earlier
period. Homer sometimes calls Lacedæmon the abode
of Menelaus; by Lacedæmon meaning the entire
country, and especially the valley round Sparta, which
agrees far better with the epithet of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hollow</span></em> Lacedæmon,”</span>
than the district of Amyclæ, which opens down to
the sea.<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a> Sometimes he expressly
mentions Sparta as the city in which Menelaus has fixed his
abode.<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href="#note_360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a>

13. Amyclæ, however, is not the only Achæan city
which was not reduced by the Dorians till a late period.
Ægys, on the frontiers of Arcadia, is said to have been
taken from the Achæans by Archelaus and Charilaus
a short time before Lycurgus; Pharis, together with
Geronthræ, by Teleclus;<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a> and Helos in the
plains, near the mouth of the Eurotas, by Alcamenes, the
son of Teleclus.<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> So long as these places belonged to
the Achæans, the Spartans were shut out from the
sea, and surrounded on all sides by the possessions of
a different race. It appears, however, that other
places besides Sparta were held by the Dorians themselves
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
previously to their obtaining possession of the
whole of Laconia; such were, for instance, Bœæ near
Malea,<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>
and perhaps also Abia on the confines of
Messenia.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a>
But of the numerous contests which
doubtless took place at this period, little information
has come down to us, as they just lie between the provinces
of mythology and history.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus much, however, we may with safety say,
that Ephorus is clearly in error when he mentions
a division of Laconia made by the Dorians, immediately
after their conquest, for the sake of an undisturbed
dominion over the country.<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> The same historian
further states that <span class="tei tei-q">“Sparta was reserved by
the Dorians as the seat of their own empire; that
Amyclæ<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> was granted to Philonomus, who had
delivered the country to them by treachery, and that
governors were sent into the other four divisions.”</span>
Also, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the principal towns of these four provinces
were Las, Epidaurus Limera (or Gytheium), Ægys,
and Pharis; of which the first served as the citadel
of Laconia,<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href="#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a> the second as an excellent harbour, the
third as a convenient arsenal for the wars with
Arcadia, and the fourth as an internal point of union.
That the periœci dwelt in these towns, and were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dependent upon the Spartans, though without losing
their freedom.”</span> This account doubtless suited the
historical style of Ephorus; but it does not agree with
the isolated but genuine traditions already mentioned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The division into six provinces is nevertheless, in
my opinion, to be considered as an historical fact; only
the arrangement could not have been made till a much
later period. Of these provinces, the first comprehended
the district of the city; the second, the mountain-chain
of Taygetus, with the western coast; the
third, the Laconian gulf; the fourth, perhaps the
modern Zaconia, on the eastern side of the Eurotas;
the fifth, the northern frontier; and the sixth, the lower
valley of the Eurotas. The reality of such a division
is also confirmed by the existence of a similar one in
Messenia; which is spoken of by other writers besides
Ephorus.<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a> For this country is also said to have been
divided by Cresphontes, so that Stenyclarus was the
habitation of the Dorians and their king, under whose
authority were placed the Messenian districts of Pylos,
Rhium, Mesola, and Hyamia; of these, Pylos apparently
comprehended the whole western coast; Rhium
is the promontory of Methone and the neighbouring
southern coast; Hyamia may perhaps be the shore of
the Messenian bay nearest to the frontiers of Laconia;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mesola signifies the midland district<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a> near the Pamisus;
and Stenyclarus is the northern plain of
Messenia.

14. We have now another instance of the arbitrary
manner in which Ephorus composed his history by
probable arguments. He proceeds upon the fact that
Eurysthenes and Procles, although the founders of
Sparta, were not honoured as such (as ἀρχηγέται),
that they did not enjoy any divine honour, did not give
their name to any tribe, &amp;c. (Now the very first of
these statements is false; for Eurysthenes and Procles,
according to the native tradition, were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the founders
of Sparta, as was shown above.) Hence Ephorus
infers that they must have offended the Dorians; and
he finds the cause of this offence in the adoption of
foreign citizens, through whose assistance they had
extended their power. This instance is a sufficient
justification for our rejecting the historical system of
Ephorus, and neglecting the results which he obtained
by it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There must have been many stories concerning
Eurysthenes and Procles current in ancient times
which have not come down to us. There was a
general tradition of their continual discord; and we
know that the military fame of Procles was as great
as that of Eurysthenes was insignificant.<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a> There is,
however, something peculiarly worthy of notice in an incidental
remark of Cicero,<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a> that Procles died a year
before Eurysthenes. Could there have been chronicles
of so early a period, or is it possible that tradition
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should preserve such precise dates? It is also a remarkable
statement that the wives of both kings were
likewise twin sisters, Lathria and Anaxandra by name,
daughters of Thersander king of the Cleonæans,
whose descent we mentioned above.<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> Some great

said that he had carried on war against the Cleitorians;
and it was related, that in the narrow valley of Cleitor,
when surrounded by enemies, and oppressed by intolerable
thirst, he promised to give up all his conquests,
on the condition of himself and his army being allowed
to drink from the fountain: that upon this he offered
the crown to any one who would abstain from drinking,
but, no one being willing to gain it at this price, he
moistened himself with water from the fountain, and
departed without drinking.<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> But a Spartan king
would hardly have ventured, even some centuries afterwards,
to lead an army through the hostile territory of
Arcadia, to a place at so considerable a distance as
Cleitor, leaving behind so many hollow defiles, ravines,
and mountains.

at first seated themselves in the opposite part of the
country, at Stenyclarus, in the midland region; they
must however have soon pressed so closely upon
Pylos, that part of the inhabitants was forced to
emigrate. For that many of the noble families, both
at Athens and in Asia Minor, came originally from
Pylos, is placed out of doubt by the agreement of
many national and family traditions; and it is equally
certain that they did not leave Peloponnesus long
before the Ionic migration. Mimnermus, the most
ancient witness to this fact, says that the founders
of his native city Colophon came from the Nelean
Pylos;<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>

Colophon, a Pylian; where it almost seems that the
poet meant a direct migration from that place. Pylos
however (though it is generally considered to have

probably remained for some time an independent town,
with a limited territory; even in the second Messenian war some
Nestoridæ went as allies to the Messenians;<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a>

16. Of the internal condition of Messenia we cannot
even know so much as of that of Laconia, since, at
the cessation of its political existence, its monuments,
and even its inhabitants, perished; and thus all means
of perpetuating a knowledge of its former state were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
entirely lost. Yet, setting aside the accounts of
Ephorus, there remain some very simple circumstances
from which we may form an idea of the condition
of the country. It is related, that when Cresphontes
was treacherously assassinated, the Arcadians,
in conjunction with the kings of Sparta and Ceisus
king of Argos, re-established in his place his son
Æpytus,<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a> who had been brought up with Cypselus the
Arcadian, the father of his mother Merope,<a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href="#note_383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a> and who
rendered himself so celebrated, that all his descendants
were called Æpytidæ. The name of Æpytus is
evidently connected with Æpytis, a district on the
frontiers of Arcadia and Messenia, near the ancient
Andania, the earliest seat of civilization and religious
worship in the country. The names of his descendants,
Glaucus, Isthmius, Dotades, Sybotas (swine-herd),
Phintas (or Φιλητὴς), are in remarkable contrast
with those of the Lacedæmonian kings, as Eurysthenes
(widely-ruling), Procles (the renowned), Agis
(the general), Soüs (the violent), Echestratus (the
general), Eurypon (the widely-reigning), Labotas
(shepherd of the people), and so forth; for, whilst the
latter signify powerful warrior princes, there sounds in
the former something peaceable and pastoral. What
Pausanias relates of these Messenian princes refers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
almost exclusively to a peaceful office—viz., the establishment
of festivals; the gods also to whom they
were consecrated agree with the same general character.
Glaucus and Isthmius, we are told, established
or promoted the worship of Æsculapius at
Gerenia and Pharæ: Sybotas joined to the ancient
worship of the great gods at Andania the funeral
sacrifices of the hero Eurytus, brought over from the
Thessalian to the Messenian Œchalia; and others in
the same manner. In fact this Cabirian worship of
Demeter at Andania, allied to that prevalent in Attica
at Eleusis and Phyla, was one of the most ancient in
Peloponnesus, and at that time flourished in Messenia;<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a>
whereas, according to Herodotus, the Dorians
everywhere exterminated the ancient rites of Demeter.<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a>
Hence also the mystical consecration of
Andania was discontinued as long as Messenia was
governed by the Spartans, and it fell into oblivion,
until many centuries afterwards Epaminondas solemnly
re-established it, either from the mere recollection
of the inhabitants, or, if the account be true,
upon the authority of an inscription on a tin plate
found in a brazen urn, containing some obscure words
referring to ancient mystic ceremonies.<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a>

The re-establishment of Æpytus may, however, have
been effected by the threefold alliance of both the
princes and nations of Argos, Sparta, and Messenia,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epidaurus</span></span>, and

the two last states more or less recognised the supremacy
of Argos, and not unfrequently followed a
common leader. These extend as far as the southern
extremity of Asia Minor.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Dorians on the south-western coast of Asia
Minor derived their origin, according to Herodotus,<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href="#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a>
from Peloponnesus. And indeed they were generally
considered a colony of Argos<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href="#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> (from which state
Strabo derives Rhodes, Halicarnassus, Cnidus, and
Cos), led by princes of the Heraclidæ, from whom the
noble families of Rhodes—for example, the Eratidæ
or Diagoridæ at Ialysus—claimed to be descended.<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a>
This emigration was considered contemporary, and as
having some connexion with the expedition of Althæmenes,
the son of Ceisus, from Argos to Crete.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a>
Now we know from Herodotus<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a> that the Coans,
Calydnians, and Nisyrians came from Epidaurus;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet, as is evident from arguments already brought
forward, two different expeditions cannot be understood
to have taken place. Thus also Ægina was
called a colony of Argos as well as of Epidaurus.
The account of Herodotus is confirmed by the similarity
of the worship of Æsculapius at Cos and at
Epidaurus, which was sufficiently great to prove a
colonial connexion.<a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a> We have also a tradition of
some sacred missions between Cos and Epidaurus; a
ship of the latter is said to have brought a serpent of Æsculapius
to the former state.<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href="#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a> If this is considered
as an historical fact, we may, as it appears, deduce
more from it than is commonly inferred—viz. that the
Doric colonists of Cos, Calydna, &amp;c. remained in Epidaurus
a sufficient time before their passage into Asia
Minor to adopt the worship of Æsculapius. And
since we find that the worship of Æsculapius also
prevailed in Cnidos and Rhodes,<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a> it may be fairly inferred,
that of the inhabitants of these islands a part
at least passed through Epidaurus. This is further
confirmed by the orator Aristides, who, on the authority
of the national tradition, states of the Rhodians,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that from ancient times they had been
Dorians, and had had Heraclidæ and Asclepiadæ
for their princes.”</span><a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a> Thus also there were families
of the Asclepiadæ and Heraclidæ at Cos, to the former
of which Hippocrates was related on his father's side, to the
latter on his mother's.<a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a> Contemporaneous

that from Trœzen,<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a> in which Halicarnassus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the citadel

2. Those towns, however, only which composed
the Doric Tripolis of Rhodes (a number which probably
originated from the division of the tribes), together
with Cnidos, Cos, and Halicarnassus, formed the
regular Doric league (before the separation of Halicarnassus
called the Hexapolis, afterwards the Pentapolis).
The members of this alliance met on the
Triopian promontory to celebrate in public national
festivals the rites of Apollo and Demeter, which last
were of extreme antiquity;<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a>

Syme also was colonised from Cnidos: of this town
we shall make further mention when speaking of
the Laconian settlements. The inhabitants of Astypalæa
were partly derived from Megara;<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> their Doric origin is attested by the dialect

and by the same circumstance we are enabled
to recognise as a Doric colony Anaphe,<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> which is situated near the Doric

and Melos; the position of these islands,
together forming a chain across the southern part
of the Ægæan sea, shows that they were colonized
in a connected and regular succession. Myndus,
however, upon the mainland had received inhabitants
from the same town as Halicarnassus;<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a> perhaps Mylasa had also had some connexion

I have now, though not without in some measure
forestalling the regular course of these investigations,
given an account of all the known cities in this territory
which were founded by Dorians of Peloponnesus;

the opposite coast of Asia, and the cities of Lycia
founded from the island of Crete, in which the Doric
dialect was doubtless spoken, we shall have before
us a very extensive range of colonies belonging to
that race. Some of these were probably dependent

3. Having thus put together the most simple historical
accounts respecting the foundation of these
Doric cities, we have still to examine the mythical
narrations with which they are accompanied, and
which were invented by representing the same colonies
under different names, and attributing a false antiquity
to their establishment. That this was in fact the case
is evident from the mythical account which is connected
with the colony of Trœzen, viz. <span class="tei tei-q">“that Anthes
and his son Aëtius, ancient princes of the Trœzenians, had in
early times founded Halicarnassus.”</span><a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a>
This tradition, however, contradicts itself, when compared
with the additional account in Callimachus,<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“that Anthes had taken out Dymanes with him;”</span>
which was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exclusively</span></em> a civil division of the Dorians.
It is therefore far preferable to follow the statement of
Pausanias,<a id="noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href="#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a> that the descendants of Aëtius passed over
to Halicarnassus and Myndus long after his death. It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must not, however, from this circumstance be inferred
that these descendants of Aëtius were leaders of the
colony, since it was necessary that these should be
Doric Heraclidæ. But they were in all probability a
family which cultivated the worship of Poseidon in
preference to any other, and carried it over with them
to the colony. But that a family of this kind, and
with it the tradition and name of Anthes, actually prevailed
in Halicarnassus, is seen also from the poetical
name of the Halicarnassians (Antheadæ.)<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422" href="#note_422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is also a great similarity in the part which
Tlepolemus bears in the history of the colonisation of
Rhodes. In this case also the mythical hero is represented
as coming from Argos,<a id="noteref_423" name="noteref_423" href="#note_423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a> as well as the historical
colony, only at an earlier period. But, it may be objected,
the colony is related to have come immediately
from Epidaurus, and not the hero. We have, however,
still an evident trace of mythical genealogies of Rhodes,
in which Tlepolemus was represented as immediately
connected with the Heraclidæ of Epidaurus. For Pindar
celebrates the Diagoridæ as descended on the father's
side from Zeus, from Amyntor on the mother's, because both
these were the grandfathers of Tlepolemus.<a id="noteref_424" name="noteref_424" href="#note_424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">424</span></span></a>
Now Deiphontes of Epidaurus was also descended
on his mother's side from Amyntor, and was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
therefore very nearly related to Tlepolemus. We may
also probably suppose that there was in this Argive and
Epidaurian colony a family which derived itself from
Tlepolemus the son of Hercules, by which means the
traditions concerning him were connected with this
migration.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href="#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a> The same want of consistency which we
observed above, may here also be perceived in the statement
of Homer, that the colony of Tlepolemus was
divided into three parts, according to the different races
of the settlers;<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href="#note_426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">426</span></span></a> whence it is evident that he was always
considered as a Doric prince.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, the colony of Cos, Nisyrus, Carpathus,
and Casos also possessed leaders or heroic founders,
whose expedition is reported to have taken place at
a time different from that at which the colony was
founded, and is placed back in a remote period, viz.
Phidippus and Antiphus, sons of Thessalus the Heraclide,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or of Hercules himself. Their origin is derived
by the fable from the irruption of Hercules into
Cos, where he made pregnant the daughter of Euryphylus;
afterwards they are said to have migrated to
Ephyra in Thesprotia, and their descendants to have
gone from thence to Thessaly, where the Aleuadæ, the
most distinguished and the wealthiest family of Larissa,
claimed them as ancestors.<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a>
Again, I do not deny that
Heraclide families in exile at Cos derived their origin
from both these heroes (it was indeed by this means
that the name of Thessalus found its way into the
Asclepiad family of Hippocrates); but that these families
were born in the island of Cos itself, is evidently
a patriotic invention of the Coans. There were, as we
have seen, traditions respecting Phidippus and Antiphus
in Cos, and also at Ephyra in Thesprotia; which
traditions the fables and poems respecting the returns
of the heroes from Troy, endeavoured to reconcile, by
making Antiphus reach Ephyra, after a series of wanderings,
instead of going directly to Cos; a supposition
which will not gain many believers. It is also plain from the
epigram of Aristotle,<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a> that, according
to the traditions of Ephyra, that city was considered as
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">native country</span></em>, and the domicile of the two heroes;
and therefore was in direct opposition to the Coan tradition.
Now that a Heraclide family should have gone
from Cos to Ephyra in Epirus, is contrary to all other
examples of the migrations of Greek races and colonies,
and all that we know of the dispersion of Heraclide
clans or families. On the other hand, a part of
the mythology of Hercules, which appears to be of
great antiquity,<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a> refers to this Ephyra in Epirus; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it was then quite natural, that with the conquest of
Ephyra (a fabulous exploit of Hercules) the origin of
a branch of the Heraclidæ should be connected, who
then came with the Dorians into Peloponnesus, and
by means of the Epidaurian colony to the island of
Cos.

4. The favourable situations of these Doric cities
on islands and promontories, possessing roadsteads and
harbours convenient for maritime intercourse, attracted
in early times a considerable number of colonies. It
is remarkable that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rhodians</span></span> should have founded
fewer and less considerable colonies on the coast of
Asia Minor than in the countries to the west: for,
with the exception of Peræa, which was not till later
times dependent on this island, the only Rhodian
towns in Asia Minor were Gagæ<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> and Corydalla<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href="#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> in
Lycia, Phaselis,<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> on the confines of Lycia and Pamphylia,
and Soli in Cilicia.<a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> On the other hand, in
Olymp. 16. 4. 713 B.C., according to Thucydides,
about the time of their colonising Phaselis, they founded
in Sicily the splendid city of Gela, the mother-town of
Agrigentum. This colony was sent from Lindus, which furnished
its leader Antiphemus (or Deinomenes.)<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a>
It was accompanied by inhabitants of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
small island of Telos;<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a> and was at the same time joined
by some Cretan emigrants. That however the numbers
of those who came from the first-mentioned town
predominated, is shown by the original name of the
settlement, Λίνδιοι, and by the religion there established.
Doric institutions were common to all the founders
above mentioned, and were consequently established in
their settlements.<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> The connexion and intercourse
with those islands continued without interruption;
hence it was that, in later times, the family of Phalaris,
coming from Astypalæa, found a welcome
reception at Agrigentum;<a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a> and the family of the
Emmenidæ, which overthrew Phalaris, had come from
the same region, viz. from Thera.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> Moreover, Parthenope,
in the country of the Osci, and Elpiæ, or
Salapiæ, in the territory of the Daunians (in the
founding of which the inhabitants of Cos had a share),
were beyond a doubt settlements of the Rhodians; and
indeed this same people penetrated even to Iberia at
an early period, and there founded Rhode; and we
have also traces of their presence at the mouth of the
Rhone.<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> Hence also, perhaps, arose the account of
the expedition of Tlepolemus to the Balearic islands;
which account, and the statement that Sybaris was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
founded by him, may be understood merely as mythical
expressions for the voyages undertaken by the Rhodians
in the western sea.

5. It is, however, a matter even of still greater
difficulty to determine the true history of several cities
in Asia Minor, which are reported by tradition to have
been colonies of Argos, and generally of the greatest
antiquity. But it requires nothing short of absolute
superstition to believe that Tarsus was founded by Io,
or Perseus the Argive,<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> who, with his descendant
Hercules, was worshipped in this place as a tutelar
deity;<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> or that Mallus, Mopsuestia, Mopsucrene, and
Phaselis were founded by Argive soothsayers at the
time of the Trojan war.<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a> To these may be added
Aspendus in Pamphylia, Curium in Cyprus, and even Ione, near Antiochia,
in Syria,<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a> the founding of which
place is attributed to the Argives. For, without considering
the period at which the ancient Peloponnesians
are represented to have undertaken such
distant (and at that time impossible) voyages round
the Chelidonian islands, it is most singular that Argos,
which is at no time mentioned among the maritime
nations of Greece, should have planted upon that one
line of coast a series of colonies in so connected an
order, and so completely useless to herself. We will
therefore venture to advance an hypothesis, to which,
though perhaps no complete proofs of it can be adduced,
we have still sufficient traces to lead us, viz.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that all these towns were colonised from Rhodes; but
that, by a form frequently in use, they were led out in
the name of Argos, the mother-country of Rhodes, and
under the auspices of Argive gods and
heroes.<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> In the
first place, Argives and Rhodians are mentioned together
as founders; as in the instance of Soli, which
nevertheless only defended the Rhodians as a sister
state before the Roman senate.<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> Of the manner in
which heroes were adopted as founders, the city just
mentioned furnishes a good instance. For the Argive
soothsayer Amphilochus is said to have come hither,
who, according to poems that went under the name of
Hesiod, had been put to death by Apollo at
Soli.<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a> The
following example gives a still clearer notion of the
manner in which these fables were formed. The
Rhodians built Phaselis at the same time with Gela
(Olymp. 16. 713 B.C.); the founder is called Lacius,
whom the Delphian oracle had sent to the east, as it
had Antiphemus to the west.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a> Now it is shown in
another part of this
work<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a> that Lacius is a Cretan
form for Rhacius; and this was the name of the husband
of Manto, and father of Mopsus, the ancient
mythical prophet of the temple at Claros. For, leaving
no doubt that this person is intended, the tradition
also says, that this Mopsus, the son of Rhacius,
founded Phaselis:<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a> Pamphylia itself is called the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
daughter of Rhacius and of Manto;<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a> and lastly, the
same Lacius is represented as a contemporary of
Mopsus, and as having been sent out by Manto as a
founder at the same time with the latter.<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a>
The inference that we must draw is, that there was no such
individual as Lacius who led the Lindians in person to
Phaselis, but that he was merely a mythical being, and
represents the Clarian oracle, which seems to have co-operated
on this occasion.<a id="noteref_452" name="noteref_452" href="#note_452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">452</span></span></a> Those who are versed in
the interpretation of mythical narratives will also
hence infer, that the same was the case with his contrary,
Ἀντιόφημος. In order, however, to give the
mother-state, Argos, a share in the mythical account
of the foundation of the Pamphylian colonies, it was
necessary that Amphilochus, who belonged to the
family of the Amythaonidæ, should, together with
Calchas, have some connexion with them all; and, in
fact, it is not impossible that soothsayers from Argos,
who called themselves descendants of this prophet and
hero, were procured by the Rhodians for this service.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. We may now penetrate somewhat deeper into
the obscure traditions of the Cilician cities Mallus,
Mopsuestia, and Mopsucrene. In the fables concerning
the founding of these towns, Amphilochus and
Mopsus are always mentioned together; at the same
time that the account of their Argive origin is very
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
much brought into notice. Cicero calls both these
prophets on this occasion kings of Argos.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a> Here
then we may also assume that soothsayers were
brought from the mother-country, and suppose that
the prophets of the Amphilochian oracle of Mallus
were actually natives of Argos; and although, as will
be shown below, the influence of the Clarian worship
was also felt,<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a> yet the persons who were the real
colonisers could only have been a sea-faring people,
such as the Rhodians. In consequence, however, of
these settlements having been founded at a very early
period, when all colonies were as yet entirely dependent
upon the oracles, and therefore were always
under the direction of prophets, and as an inventive
and imaginative spirit was then in full vigour, their
true history has been enveloped in a thick cloud of
mythological fiction, which we have at least begun
to remove.

7. We next proceed to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Corinthian</span></span> colonies,
the geographical situation of which alone affords a
remarkable result with regard to the maritime expeditions
undertaken by the mother-country. For
although Corinth had two harbours, Lechæum in
the Crisæan, and Cenchreæ in the Saronic gulf, it
it evident that all its colonies were sent out from the
western port. They were founded, almost without
exception, on the coasts of the Ionian sea; at the
entrance of which the Corinthians had, perhaps at a very
early period, founded the city of Molycreium.<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href="#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a>
Notwithstanding this, the very first colony from Corinth,
the date of which is known within a few years
(Olymp. 5. 760-757 B.C.),<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> ventured to cross the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Ionian sea, and to found in the most beautiful part of
Sicily the renowned city of Syracuse. The founder
was Archias a Heraclide, and probably also of the
family of the Bacchiadæ;<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href="#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a> he was followed by Corinthians,
chiefly from the borough of Tenea;<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> and on
the road was joined by some Dorians from Megara;<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>
the expedition was also accompanied by a prophet
of the sacred family of Olympia, the Iamidæ, whose
descendants flourished at Syracuse in the time of
Pindar.<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a> It appears, however, that Syracuse at that
time borrowed many religious institutions from
Olympia, as is proved by the worship of Arethusa,
of Artemis Ortygia, and of the Olympian
Zeus.<a id="noteref_461" name="noteref_461" href="#note_461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a> These
original founders built a town in the island of Ortygia,
the name of which can be explained only from the
worship of the goddess just mentioned. The lands
taken from the aboriginal Sicilians they divided into
lots, according to the number of the colonists. For
the method universally observed in founding these
colonies was, that the adventurers received before-hand
a promise of a share in the territory—which also
was called a lot. On the occasion of this very settlement,
Æthiops, a Corinthian glutton, is said to have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sold a promise of this kind to a companion for one
honey-cake.<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a> Eumelus the Bacchiad, the celebrated
poet of Corinth, seems to have been one of these
colonists,<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href="#note_463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a> as he is mentioned in connexion with
Archias. Although the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demus</span></span>, or populace of the
city, chiefly perhaps consisted of inhabitants of various
nations, who put themselves under the protection of
this colony, and although the territory around was
peopled by Sicilian bondsmen, yet in its dialect, and
probably for a considerable period in its customs also,
Syracuse remained a purely Doric state: as the
women in Theocritus say,<a id="noteref_464" name="noteref_464" href="#note_464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">464</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Our origin is Corinthian,
and therefore we speak the language of Peloponnesus.
For it is permitted, I suppose, to the
Dorians to speak Doric.</span></span>”</span> Hence the Syracusans
were so greatly pleased with an ambassador from
Lucania, who had learnt to speak Doric in order
to address them in their native tongue.<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a> Syracuse
increased so rapidly in population and power,
that seventy years after its foundation it colonized
Acræ, and also Enna, situated in the centre of the
island; twenty years after this, the town of Casmenæ; and in
forty-five more, Camarina. Also some Syracusan<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a>
fugitives named Myletidæ, together with Chalcideans
from Zancle, are said to have founded Himera:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hence the dialect there in use was a mixture of Chalcidean
and Doric; but the institutions were entirely
Chalcidean.

8. The other Corinthian colonies, as has been
already remarked, were all situated to the east of
the Ionian sea. The nearest of these are, besides their colony
of Molycreium, Chalcis in Ætolia,<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a> and
Solium in Acarnania;<a id="noteref_468" name="noteref_468" href="#note_468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">468</span></span></a> further on, we find that Ambracia was
in very early times founded by Corinth,<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a>
and accordingly was governed by a brother of
Periander;<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a> by the influence of this settlement Amphilochian
Argos changed its language and customs
for those of the Greeks.<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href="#note_471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a> Anactorium was founded
by the Corinthians, under the command of Periander,
in conjunction with the Corcyræans. At the same
time, and in connexion with the same persons, they
occupied the island of Leucadia;<a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472" href="#note_472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a> to the possession of
which, however, the Corcyræans, as they were at that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time subject to Corinth, had no just claim; and Themistocles
unquestionably did wrong in attributing any
such right to them;<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473" href="#note_473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a> the Leucadians also always
remained firm to their real parent-state. Next comes
Corcyra itself, the founding of which by Chersicrates
the Bacchiad<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a> is represented as having been a secondary
branch of the colony sent to Syracuse;<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a> but
it had at a very early period set itself up as a rival
to the mother-state in the Ionian sea, whose ancient
power had been probably broken before the Persian
war. On the opposite coast lay Epidamnus, which
city was chiefly founded by Corcyræans, but under
the command of Phalius, the son of Eratocleides, a
Corinthian Heraclide, whom the Corcyræans, according
to the ancient colonial law, had sent for, together with
some of his countrymen (in Olymp. 38. 2. 629 B.C.
according to Eusebius), and were afterwards strengthened
by emigrants from Dyspontium in Pisatis.—Lastly,
Gylax, a Corinthian, together with 200 of
his own countrymen, and a greater number of Corcyræans,
founded Apollonia in the time of Periander.
Here ends the list of Corinthian colonies, which formed
a strong and continuous chain along the coast; and
thus even the barbarians of the interior, especially the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Epirots of Thesprotia, were forced to maintain a perpetual
connexion with Corinth:<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a> hence also the kings
of the Lyncestæ in Macedonia esteemed it an honour
to derive their origin from the Bacchiadæ.<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href="#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> At a still further distance lay the island of Issa, which was
colonized from Syracuse.<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> Corcyra, however, possessed settlements as far as the
Flanatian gulf.<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href="#note_479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">479</span></span></a>
From these facts it is evident that there was a time
when Corinth predominated in these seas; and by
means of Corcyra and Ambracia, and other towns,
ruled over many nations of barbarians. But the loss
of Corcyra, which had been at war with its mother-state
in the 28th Olympiad (about 668 B.C.),<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a> even
before the time of Periander (though it was for a short
time again reduced to subjection by the enterprising
Cypselidæ), was an incurable wound for Corinth. The
other colonies, however, showed a remarkable obedience
to her.<a id="noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a> It was not till after the loss of their
maritime dominion in these quarters (an event which
had nevertheless taken place before the Persian war)
that the Corinthians appear to have founded Potidæa
on the opposite side of Greece in Chalcidice, which
colony they sought to retain in their power by continually
interfering in its internal administration, and
for this purpose sent thither every year magistrates
named Epidemiurgi.<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Megara</span></span>, on the other hand, was induced by
its situation to send even its first colonies to the opposite
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
side of Greece on the Thracian coast. Thus in Olymp. 17. 3.
710 B.C. it founded Astæus in Bithynia;<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a>
afterwards Chalcedon, on the entrance of the
Bosporus<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> in Olymp. 26. 2. 675 B.C. (according to
Eusebius); and 17 years later (Olymp. 30. 3. 658
B.C.) Byzantium in a more favoured spot, opposite
to Chalcedon.<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a> The Argives also had a share in the
foundation of this town; for which fact we may trust
the general assertion of Hesychius of Miletus, that
his circumstantial and fabulous history of the early
times of this city was derived from ancient poets and
historians. For the transmission of the worship of
Here (whose temple both at Byzantium and Argos
was on the citadel),<a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> and the traditions concerning Io,
the attendant of the Argive Here, confirm in a manner
which does not admit of a doubt, the pretensions of
Argos to a share in this colony. Io, who was represented
with horns on her forehead, is said to have here
produced to Zeus a daughter, Ceroëssa the <span class="tei tei-q">“Horned”</span>
by name (which is, however, only a different name for
Io herself), who being suckled by the nymph Semestra,
afterwards brought forth Byzas.<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> Thence the
fable of the cow swimming over the sea became peculiar
to this place.<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> In other respects the combinations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of religious ceremonies as found at Byzantium,
almost exactly resembled that which existed in Megara.
Nay, so carefully did the Byzantians, though
far removed from their mother-state, preserve the
remembrance of it, that they carried over almost all
the names of their native country and the neighbouring
region. We find on the coast a temple of Poseidon,
whose son was named Byzas; also of Demeter
and Cora; the Scironian rocks, an Isthmian promontory,
with the tomb of Hipposthenes a Megarean hero,
the temple of Apollo on the high promontory of
Metopum; also an altar of Saron, a pretended hero,
whose name referred to the Saronic gulf.<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> Thus
Byzantium was never estranged from its Peloponnesian
ancestors, although it adopted a large number of
additional colonists,<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> and ruled over Thracian subjects.
Moreover, the prevailing dialect, which occurs in some
public decrees still extant, remained for a long time
Doric.<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a> The Byzantians, together with the Chalcedonians,
either at the time of the expedition of Darius
against the Scythians, or of the Ionic revolt, founded
Mesambria on the Pontus,<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a> which some consider as
a colony of Megara. The Megareans had also founded
Selymbria even before the settlement of Byzantium,<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a>
and probably carried on from this place a war with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Samians at Perinthus,<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> when that island was still
governed by Geomori, before the time of Polycrates.
Moreover, the Megareans had a large share in the
founding of Heraclea on the Pontus; for although
they were strengthened by some Tanagræans from
Bœotia, their numbers so predominated that this city
was in general considered as Doric.<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a>

10. Megara, however, at the same time founded
some very considerable colonies to the west, viz., in
Sicily. It will be sufficient to state in general terms
that Hybla in Sicily was a Megarean colony, established
in the 13th Olympiad (about 728 B.C.), and
was even called Megara.<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496" href="#note_496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">496</span></span></a> It probably kept up a
constant intercourse with the mother-state; since
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Theognis, who was a Megarean from Sicily, according
to Plato, dwelt nevertheless for a long time in the
Megara near Athens, to which state many of his
poems refer.<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497" href="#note_497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a> The founding of the small town of
Trogilus, and of the more important city of Thapsos,
preceded the building of Megara. A century later,
some inhabitants of Megara founded Selinus in the
neighbourhood of that part of the island, which town
was in early times held by the Phœnicians, in later
times by the Carthaginians.

11. The colonies of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sparta</span></span>, which still remain
to be considered, were more numerous than would
be expected of a state so averse to maritime affairs.
In the history of the migrations of the Heraclidæ, we
find introduced the colonies of Thera, Melos, Gortyna,
and Cyrene; which, although for the sake of honour
they recognised Sparta as their mother-state, had been
in fact founded by Achæans, Minyans, and Ægidæ,
who dwelt at that time in a state of almost entire independence
in a district of Laconia.<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href="#note_498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a> All these states,
however, retained the Doric name; and Cyrene,
though even the founders married Libyan women,<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
always preserved to the utmost of its power the institutions, customs, and
language of its mother-country.<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a>
The founding of Cnidos also took place at an early period, and
was generally ascribed to the Lacedæmonians.<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a>
The leader of the colony was, according to
Diodorus, one Hippotes.<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href="#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a> Syme also was at that time
peopled from Cnidos.<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a> The principal religion of
this city, that of Aphrodite<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href="#note_504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a> (who was here worshipped in
a three-fold capacity), was without doubt the same as
that which existed at Cythera, having been carried
over by the Lacedæmonian colonists. The splendid
city of Cnidos, protected toward the east by an Acropolis,
which both its Cyclopian architecture<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a> and
fabulous history prove to have existed before the time
of the Dorians, was situated on a neck of land, with a
harbour on each side, one of which was among the
largest in Greece. Thus fitted by nature for commerce,
Cnidos also founded colonies of its own, among
which Lipara, established (in Olymp. 50, about 580
B.C.) upon one of the Æolian islands under the direction
of descendants of Hippotes,<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a> overcame the Etruscans
in several wars, and adorned Delphi with offerings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of victory.<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href="#note_507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> Another colony from Cnidos, remarkable
chiefly for its distance from the mother-country, is
Black-Corcyra, on the coast of Illyria. Lacedæmon
herself, however, is said to have sent out colonies to
Phrygia, Pisidia, and Cyprus. In the former country,
Pisistratus, a Spartan, is said to have founded Noricum
near Celænæ on the river Marsyas.<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href="#note_508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> Selge in Pisidia
is generally considered by the ancients to have been a
Lacedæmonian colony, and we frequently find on coins
of a late date this origin recognised. The representative
of the state is Hercules the Doric hero: moreover,
the free spirit, the bravery, and the good laws of
the Selgæans (although the reverse is sometimes attributed
to them) were derived from their mother-state.<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href="#note_509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a>
The wrestling youths in the act of grasping
one another (ἀκροχειριζόμενοι) represented on their
coins, bespeak a love for gymnastic exercises. It
should, however, be remembered, that the founders of
this colony were, according to a more exact statement,
Amyclæans,<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href="#note_510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> fugitive Periœci, who perhaps had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
passed through Cnidos in their way to these districts.
It appears that the Selgæans founded Sagalassus,<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a>
which city is styled on its coins <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Lacedæmonian</span></span>.
Perhaps Praxander went at the same time from
Therapne in Laconia, with Cephas of Olenus (both
Achæans by birth) to the island of Cyprus, where
they founded Lapathus and Ceronia.<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href="#note_512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a>

12. But the most celebrated of all the Lacedæmonian
colonies, and which really proceeded from
Sparta, was Tarentum. The history of its origin is
buried in fable, in the accounts of the first Messenian
war; the accompanying circumstances will be
mentioned below. The leader of this colony was
Phalanthus, son of Aratus, a Heraclide.<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href="#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a> Taras, on
the other hand, is called the son of Poseidon, because
this colony carried over the worship of that deity from
Tænarum to Italy. These emigrants also brought
with them other religious rites, as for instance the worship
of Hyacinthus;<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href="#note_514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a> likewise many names from their
native country, as that of the Eurotas, which they gave to the
river Galæsus.<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href="#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a> But the fruitful and luxuriant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
territory to which they had moved, its soft and voluptuous
climate, and the commerce, for which Tarentum
was well situated,<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href="#note_516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a> and always open (although it
never carried it on in an active manner), helped to engender
that effeminacy of character, which gave countenance
to the fable of the founders having been the sons of unmarried
women (παρθενίαι). Still, amidst all its
degeneracy, Tarentum retained a certain degree of
dependence on its mother-country: at the foundation
of Heraclea the Tarentines allowed Cleandridas a
Spartan to be one of the original colonists.<a id="noteref_517" name="noteref_517" href="#note_517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a> The friendship, moreover, of the Cnidians
with the Tarentines,<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a>
as well as that with the Cyreneans, was founded
on the recognition of a common origin. The colony
of Croton (Olymp. 19. 2. 703 B.C., according to
Eusebius) consisted indeed of Achæans, who came
partly from the maritime town of Rhypæ,<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a>
and partly from Laconia:<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a> it must, however, have been established
under the authority of the Doric state of Sparta,
since Apollo and Hercules, the Doric god and hero,
were here worshipped with especial honour;<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> the early
constitution was also Doric; and although in general
we are not to look for truth in the poetry of Ovid, yet
in this instance we may credit his statement that Myscellus
the founder was a Heraclide.<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href="#note_522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a> In like manner
the Locrians, who (in Olymp. 24. 2. 683 B.C.)
founded Locri, must have procured Spartans as
leaders,<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a> since (as their coins also show) they paid particular
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

war the statues of these gods having been sent to them
from Sparta, as being a people of the same origin;<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a>
and even in the Peloponnesian war they still adhered
to the cause of Sparta.<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href="#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> Of a nature wholly different
were the rapid and transitory settlements of Dorieus
the son of Anaxandrides, king of Sparta, which this
noble adventurer founded in Sicily and Libya; when,
scorning to submit to a worthless brother, and confiding
in his own strength, he hoped to obtain by conquest
a kingdom in a distant country.<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a> Finally, the Lyctians
of Crete and other inhabitants of this island
called themselves colonists of Sparta. In all probability
many of the ancient Doric cities of this country
received fresh settlers from Lacedæmon; which state,
at the beginning of the Olympiads<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href="#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a> in

1. Before we begin to collect and arrange the
accounts extant concerning the early history of Peloponnesus,
it will be first necessary to ascertain what
are our sources of information respecting the events
of this period. For the epic poets, who carried on
an uninterrupted series of traditions on the events of
the mythical ages, and have thus thrown over this
dark period some faint glimmerings which may in
many places be condensed into a distinct and useful
light, only touch on a few points of the period whose
history we are about to examine. On the other hand,
indeed, the art of writing was during this time introduced
among the Greeks through their intercourse
with Asia; but that a long time elapsed before it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
came into general use, is evident from the almost
surprising imperfection of those written documents
which have been preserved to us of a date anterior to
the 60th Olympiad, in comparison with the great
perfection of the works of Grecian art. For this
reason, writing was long regarded in Greece as a
foreign craft, and letters were considered (for example
in the Tean curses) as Phœnician symbols.
Nevertheless, these few and scanty registers are the
first materials for real history and chronology now
extant. As such, the following have been made
known to us from Peloponnesus.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

2. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quoit of Iphitus</span></span>, upon which was inscribed
in a circle the formula for proclaiming the
sacred armistice of Elis, and in which Iphitus and
Lycurgus were mentioned as the founders of it.<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href="#note_529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a>
There is no reason for doubting its genuineness, which
was recognised by Aristotle, and the institution which
it mentioned was considered by all ancient writers as
a real fact.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> Secondly, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lists of the
conquerors at the Olympic games</span></span> brought down uninterruptedly
from the victory of Chorœbus,<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> which always recorded
the conquerors in the foot-race, and in later times at
least those in the other games.<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a> It is probable that
they were originally engraved on single pillars, and
afterwards collected under the inspection of the Hellanodicæ.<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a>
Similar catalogues of conquerors in other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
games, besides the four great ones, were also probably
not uncommon, but they were generally inscribed on
separate pillars, and were therefore of little use to the
historian.<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a> The names of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">conquerors at the Carnean
games</span></span> at Sparta were also registered, so that
Hellanicus was enabled to compose from them a work
called Καρνεονῖκαι. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">register at Sicyon</span></span> contained
a list of the priestesses of Here at Argos, and the
poets and musicians of the games.<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a> But
this also contained fabulous accounts: for example, the invention
of playing and singing on the harp by Amphion.
Nor were the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">catalogues of the priestesses of Here</span></span>,
which were probably kept at Argos, altogether free
from fable, as may be perceived from the fragments
of Hellanicus's chronological work on these priestesses,
which was probably founded on the official catalogues.<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href="#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. There were also at Lacedæmon public registers,
in which Plutarch found mention of the daughters
of Agesilaus;<a id="noteref_537" name="noteref_537" href="#note_537"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">537</span></span></a> and in those of the earliest times the
same author discovered the Pythian oracle concerning
Lycurgus,<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a> the same that Herodotus refers to in his
first book. These doubtless contained the names of
all the kings, and probably also the years of their
reigns, as far back as Procles, who, according to a
statement noticed above, died one year before his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
brother Eurysthenes.<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href="#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a> This fact could hardly have
been derived from any other source than some national
annals, though it is not impossible that it was first
transferred to them from oral narrative; in which
case, however, it is difficult to understand how tradition,
contrary to its general character, preserved dates.
It was without doubt from these registers that Charon
of Lampsacus, before the time of Herodotus, composed
his work entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Prytanes, or Rulers,
of Lacedæmon</span></span>;”</span><a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> in which he also noticed
the sacred offerings and monuments of ancient times.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a>
With respect to the chronological labours of Timæus,
Polybius<a id="noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href="#note_542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a> says that <span class="tei tei-q">“this writer compared the ephors
with the kings of Lacedæmon from the beginning,
and the archons at Athens and priestesses at Argos
with the conquerors at the Olympic games, and
noted the errors which the cities had made in the
registration, even when they only differed by three
months.”</span> Eratosthenes and Apollodorus founded
their chronology, especially before the Olympiads,
upon the same list of the kings;<a id="noteref_543" name="noteref_543" href="#note_543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a> they both nearly
agreed in reckoning 327 or 328 years from the expedition
of the Heraclidæ to the first Olympiad (776
B.C.),<a id="noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="#note_544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a> which calculation would have been impossible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
if the duration of each king's reign had not been
known; for if this computation is made by generations,
reckoning about three to a century, quite a
different number comes out.<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a> Lycurgus, however,
was placed by Eratosthenes 108 years before the first
Olympiad;<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href="#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a> in which computation he certainly went
on the authority of the Quoit of Iphitus; which agrees
with the statement of Apollodorus, that Homer, who
according to this chronologist flourished 148 years
before the first Olympiad, was a contemporary of
Lycurgus when the latter was a young man.<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a>—It
appears, however, that the name of Lycurgus was not
preserved in any register of the kings, since in that
case it would have been impossible that he should
have been called by Herodotus the guardian of his
nephew Labotas the Eurysthenid,<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a> by
Simonides (who lived in great intimacy with king Pausanias)<a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> the son
of Prytanis and brother of Eunomus the Proclid, and
by others the son of Eunomus and guardian of his
nephew Charilaus,<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> had there existed any genealogy of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him which was sufficiently accredited. Hence we
must infer that these catalogues only contained the
names of the kings, and not even of the royal guardians
or protectors, such as Lycurgus. On the other hand,
the variations in the enumeration of the kings are
unimportant, being confined to this, that in the pedigree
of the Proclidæ Herodotus<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a> (or his transcribers)
leaves out the name of Soüs, which occurs in all the
rest, and, contrary to Pausanias, changes the order of
Eunomus and Polydectes. Since the name of Polydectes
is entirely wanting in Simonides and Eusebius,
it is probable that Polydectes and Eunomus are only
different names of the same king; and that Polydectes
was the proper name, and Eunomus a title
of honour.<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> Upon this hypothesis we obtain the following
series of kings of the Proclid line—Prytanis,
Polydectes, Charilaus, with tolerable certainty. There
must also have been registers of the names and years
of the princes of Corinth, and the family of the Bacchiadæ,
since no one could have had the boldness to
invent them.<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a> Indeed there were altogether many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pedigrees, particularly of the Heraclidæ: as, for example,
of families at Cyrene,<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a>
and the Ptolemies;<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a>
their authority, however, could not have been very
great; in the latter, indeed, we cannot fail to recognise
the unscrupulous hand of Alexandrine flatterers.
The ancient chronicles of Elis, which Pausanias saw,
appear to have contained complete pedigrees from
Oxylus down to Iphitus;<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a> although the descendants
of the former were not kings. The father of Iphitus
was there stated to have been also named Iphitus, in
contradiction to the common account.<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a>

4. None of these registers appear to have contained
anything beyond the names of conquerors at
the games (which have seldom any reference to history),
and princes with the years of their reigns. If
anything more was noted down, it was perhaps here
and there an oracle, as those belonging to the history
of Sparta in Herodotus,<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a> which were without doubt
brought by the Pythians to Sparta in writing, at a
very early period. To these may be perhaps added
some ancient <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rhetras</span></span>;<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a> under which term the ancient
Dorians included all political documents, laws, and
treaties. The most ancient instance of the last kind
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is the treaty between the Eleans and the inhabitants
of Heræa, discovered by sir William Gell,<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> the writing
of which is so extremely rude as to prove that they
were little practised in that art when it was engraved.
It is however very doubtful how the Spartan rhetras
of Lycurgus were drawn up. By some it has been
supposed that they were originally composed in metre,
in order to be chanted by the youth of
Sparta;<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a> but
this is contradicted by the certain testimony<a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a> that
Terpander of Antissa, whom the Spartans so highly
esteemed, was the first who set these laws to music,
and first gave them a metrical and poetical form;
and Terpander did not live till after the 26th Olympiad,
or 672 B.C.<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href="#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a> But the rhetra which Plutarch
has preserved as the genuine constitutional formula
bears a truly archaic character, since it contains a
command of the Pythian Apollo to the lawgiver in
the infinitive mood, and does not fall into verse. I do
not perceive why it might not have been written, as
well as the contemporaneous inscription on the Quoit
of Iphitus, and the ancient oracles cited by Herodotus;
at least we cannot in any other way account for the
preservation of the words. The original rhetras, however,
were very few, and formed merely the nucleus
of a system of laws, more as a help to the memory
than as a perfect code; hence the ancients could with
propriety say, that Zaleucus was the first who committed
laws to writing.<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> The three rhetras, which
were preserved besides the former one, were merely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
certain general formulas, and by no means explicit
laws; they had the form of an oracle, as having proceeded
from the Pythian god,<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href="#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a> but were written entirely
in prose.<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a>

Next in the list of public monuments come the
ὅροι, or landmarks of territory. It is well known
that we are in possession of such records of a later
period, belonging to the sacred territory of the Pythian
Apollo (in which earlier surveys of the Amphictyonic
Hieromnemons, and ancient inscriptions
on boundary-stones are appealed to), belonging to
Cretan towns, and likewise to Samos and Priene, in
which the inhabitants of Priene cite ancient records,
preserved from the time of Bias in the temple of
Athene.<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a> Historical works were also composed from

records of this kind in Peloponnesus, although the

5. These documents, if we were in possession of
them, would afford a valuable foundation for an account
of the three centuries before regular history
begins; but merely an outline, which would require
to be filled up from other sources. This might
partly be done from the writings of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lyric poets</span></span>,
who flourished at that time, as Eumelus, Thaletas,
Tyrtæus, Alcman, and Terpander;<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a> which writers
had frequent intercourse with the Spartans, and introduced
the events of the time into their poetry to
a much greater degree than the epic poets. And
in fact we find in the fragments of Tyrtæus and
Alcman a lively representation of the feelings and
manners of the period. The next source of information
is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">oral tradition</span></span>, which, though erring continually
with regard to names and numbers, yet always relates
something essential; and, finally, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">political institutions</span></span>
continuing to exist in later times, which had
their origin in this period.

These, and no other than these, can have been the
means employed by the authors who wrote on the
affairs of Laconia, in the century when history was
approaching to maturity, such as Hellanicus, Charon,
and Herodotus; and either directly or indirectly must
have afforded materials to those who treated of the
times of Lycurgus during the later age of Greek
learning. But how little do we recognise the ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
simplicity and liveliness which characterise all the
genuine remains of that time, in the historical style of
Ephorus and Hermippus,<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> and their followers. The
object of these writers was to assimilate, as much as
possible, the notions of antiquity to those of their own
time, and to attempt in some way or other to represent
every act as proceeding from such motives as would
have actuated their own contemporaries. They have
with a truly unsparing hand rubbed off the venerable
rust of ancient tradition, and, totally mistaking the
most powerful springs of action then prevalent,
moulded all events of which any records had been
preserved, into a connected form more suited to a
modern history. It is almost impossible to describe
with what unlucky zeal Plutarch, where Lycurgus
only embodied in laws the political feelings of his race
and nation, ascribes to that legislator plans and views
generally unsatisfactory, and often absolutely childish.

the history of Lycurgus, we shall find that we
have absolutely no account of him as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individual
person</span></em>. Tradition very properly represents him as
intimately connected with the temple of Delphi (by
which the Dorians, and especially the state of Sparta,
were at that time entirely led), and with Crete, the
earliest civilized state of the Doric race. This connexion
was generally represented under the form of a
journey to both places; his tomb was also shown both
at Cirrha and at Pergamia in Crete. It was easy to
imagine that the reforms of Lycurgus were violently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opposed, and produced tumults and disturbances.<a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a>
But the story of Alcander putting out one of Lycurgus's
eyes (probably a popular tale) is founded on a false explanation of
the title of Pallas Optiletis.<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a> It
was indeed an ancient tradition that he was guardian
of a Spartan king; but the common report of this
being Charilaus<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a> is not quite certain, as we have seen
above; and in order to account for both his travels and
regency, he was reported to have abdicated the latter
in order to avoid suspicion.<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href="#note_575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a> If we set aside all fictions
of this description, which have almost the spirit
of a moral tale, like the Cyropædia of Xenophon,
there remains very little traditional lore. Of his
legislation we will treat hereafter.<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a>

7. It is very singular that historians should have
mentioned so little of the action of Lycurgus, which
comes next in importance to that which has been just
discussed;<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a> I mean the share that he had in founding
the sacred armistice and games at Olympia, which
event was without doubt the commencement of a more
tranquil state of affairs in Peloponnesus. Lycurgus,
as the representative of the Doric race, Iphitus,
of the Ætolians and Eleans, and Cleosthenes,<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a> the son
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Cleonicus of Pisa, the city to which the temple of
Olympia properly belonged, and which had not then
lost the management of it, in conjunction perhaps with
several others, drew up the fundamental law of the
Peloponnesian armistice. This contained two heads.
First, that the whole territory of the Eleans (who
acted as masters of the games, after the expulsion of
the Pisatans, every year with more exclusive power)
should remain for ever free from hostile inroads and
ravages, insomuch that even armed troops were only
to be allowed a passage on condition of first laying
down their arms;<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a> secondly, that during the time of
the festival a cessation of arms should also be proclaimed
throughout the rest of Peloponnesus. But,
since there was little agreement among the individual
states in the computation of time, and as the
Eleans alone were acquainted with the exact time
at which the quadrennial festival came round, and
perhaps also in order to make the injunction of the
god more impressive, the Eleans always sent
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">feciales</span></span>
round to the different states, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">heralds of the season,

proclaimed the Olympic armistice, first to their own
countrymen, and then to the other Peloponnesians: after which time
no army was to invade another's territory.<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a>
The fine which was to have been paid by the
Spartans in the Peloponnesian war for having sent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out soldiers after this period was two minas for each
hoplite, the very sum which by the agreement of the
Peloponnesians was required for the ransom of prisoners
of war;<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> whence it is evident that the transgressors
of the truce were considered as becoming slaves of the
god, and were to be ransomed again from him. The
decree was pronounced by the tribunal of the temple
at Elis, according to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Olympian law.”</span><a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href="#note_583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a> The fine
was divided between the Eleans and the treasury at the
temple of Olympia. To this temple also were paid
all penalties incurred by the infraction of treaties;<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a>
nay, sometimes whole cities were bound to pay a fixed
tribute every year to the god.<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a> By these and similar
laws was the armistice protected, which doubtless was
not intended merely to secure the celebration of the
games from disturbance, but also to effect a peaceable
meeting of the Peloponnesians, and thus to give occasion
for the settling of disputes, and the conclusion of
alliances. Even in the Peloponnesian war public
business was transacted at this assembly.<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> But
one chief effect of the Olympian festival appears to have
been the production of a more friendly connexion between
the Ætolian and Doric races. This fact appears
to be established by the tradition that Iphitus introduced
the worship of Hercules at Elis, which therefore
had previously been peculiar to the Dorians.<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a>
Apollo, the Doric god, was also at this time regarded as the
protector of the sacred armistice of Olympia, as we
shall see
hereafter.<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a>

8. We now proceed immediately to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Messenian
wars</span></em>, since it is hardly possible to find one independent
event between the commencement of them and the
time of Iphitus. These however are really historical,
since we have in Tyrtæus a nearly contemporaneous
account of the first, and one actually so of the
second. The fragments and accounts of his poems
are our principal guides for obtaining a correct knowledge
of these transactions. And in these alone many
circumstances appear in quite a different light from
that in which they are represented in the romance of
Pausanias. In the latter, the Spartans only are the
aggressors, the Messenians only the subjects of attack;
but, if we listen to Tyrtæus, the former also had to
fight for their own country. But, since even the
ancients possessed few remains of Tyrtæus, and as
nearly all the historical part of his poems appears to
have come down to us, whence did Pausanias derive
his copious narrative, and the details with which he
has adorned it? Was it from ancient epic poets?
Yet of these there is nowhere any mention: and in
general an historical event, if it could not be put into an
entirely fabulous shape, like the stories of the origin
and foundation of many colonies, lay altogether without
the province of the early poetry. It is indeed possible
that in the Naupactia, which are referred to for the
mythical history of Messenia,<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a> some historical
notices may have occasionally occurred, perhaps too in the
works of Cinæthon and Eumelus: but the ancients,
who disliked the labour of compiling a history from
scattered fragments, probably gave themselves very
little trouble to discover them. On the other hand,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there existed a series of traditional legends, whose
character announces their high antiquity; thus, that of
the Messenians, that Aristomenes had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thrice</span></em> offered a
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">hecatomphonion</span></span>, or sacrifice for a hundred
enemies slain in battle;<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href="#note_590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">590</span></span></a> whether or no of human victims is
doubtful.<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href="#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">591</span></span></a> A share in this sacrifice was also performed
by Theoclus, who is called an Elean, because
he belonged to a family of the Iamidæ, which, as it
appears, was settled in Messenia; but this clan, though
scattered about in different places, yet always retained
their rights at Olympia.<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a> The same character may
also be perceived in the legend of Aristomenes thrice
incurring the danger of death. On the first of these
occasions, when thrown into the Ceadas, he was preserved
by a fox, the symbol of Messenia; on the
second, whilst his guards were asleep, he turned to the
fire and burnt in two the cords that bound his limbs,<a id="noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a>
a story more certainly derived from tradition than the
love-adventure which supplies its place in Pausanias:
the third time however that he fell into the hands of
his enemies, they cut open his breast, and found a
hairy heart.<a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href="#note_594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">594</span></span></a>

9. Traditions of this kind were probably circulating
in different forms among the victorious Lacedæmonians,<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a>
amongst the refugee Messenians in Italy and
Naupactus, the subject Messenians who remained in
the country, and the other Peloponnesians, when they
were recalled into existence by the re-establishment of
the Messenian state by Epaminondas. Even before
the battle of Leuctra, the Bœotians, on the advice of
an oracle, hung up as a trophy the shield of Aristomenes,<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href="#note_596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a>

when Epaminondas recalled the Messenian fugitives
from Italy, Sicily, and even from Libya, and had
erected them, with numerous Helots and people collected
from various quarters, into a new state,<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href="#note_598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a> Aristomenes
was especially invoked before the foundation of
the city.<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href="#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a> In this manner the ancient
traditions were enabled to gain a new footing, and to be developed in
a connected form. Several writers now seized upon a
subject which had begun to excite so great interest, of
whom Rhianus the poet and Myron the prose-writer
are known to us.<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href="#note_600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a> Myron gave an account of the
first Messenian war down to the death of Aristodemus;
but, in the opinion of Pausanias, utterly regardless
whether or no he related falsehood and incredibilities;
thus, in the teeth of all tradition, he introduced Aristomenes,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the hero of the second war, into the first; and
he wrote with an evident bias <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against</span></em> Sparta.<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href="#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a> Rhianus,
however, a native of Bena in Crete, celebrated
the actions of Aristomenes, in the second war, from
the battle near the Great Trench (Μεγάλη Τάφρος),
until the end of the war, as Homer had done those of
Achilles; and although Pausanias has disproved some
of his statements of particular facts from Tyrtæus,<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a>
yet he has frequently followed him, and especially in
the poetical embellishments of his narrative.<a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> He
never mentions any historians, such as Ephorus, Theopompus,
Antiochus, or Callisthenes.<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> Rhianus,
however, though he might not have exclusively adopted

from Pausanias, gave the reins to his fancy, and mixed
up many circumstances and usages of later times with
the ancient tradition.<a id="noteref_606" name="noteref_606" href="#note_606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">606</span></span></a> It is not therefore our intention

with this date that Eumelus, who was contemporary with
Archias the founder of Syracuse (in the 5th Olympiad),
composed a poem for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">free</span></em> Messenia. Pausanias
places the commencement (we know not on what

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
king who completed the subjugation of Messenia was

war, it may be first traced in the increase of power,
which Sparta, before the beginning of the Olympiads,
owed to the exertions of its king Teleclus; this prince
having succeeded in subduing the neighbouring city of
Amyclæ, and in reducing several other Achæan towns
to a state of dependence on Sparta.<a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615" href="#note_615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a> Indeed, if we

Teleclus razed the town of Nedon, on the frontiers of Messenia
and Laconia,<a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617" href="#note_617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a> and transplanted its inhabitants to the
towns of Pœessa, Echeiæ, and Tragis. Hence arose
border wars between the Dorians at Sparta and those
at Stenyclarus. The temple of Artemis Limnatis,<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618" href="#note_618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">618</span></span></a>
the possession of which was disputed between the two
nations (though its festival was common to both),
afforded, as may be discovered from the romance of
Pausanias,<a id="noteref_619" name="noteref_619" href="#note_619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">619</span></span></a> the immediate ground for the war. For
even in the reign of Tiberius the Lacedæmonians supported
their claim to this temple by ancient annals and
oracles;<a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href="#note_620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a> while the Messenians, on the other hand,
brought forward the document already quoted, according
to which this temple, together with the whole
territory of Dentheleatis, in which it was situated, belonged
to them. Dissensions in Messenia must have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hastened the breaking out of the war, since it is certain
that Hyamia, one of the five provinces of Messenia,
was given by the Spartans to the Androclidæ, a branch
of the family of the Æpytidæ.<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href="#note_621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> The history of
the first war contains traces of a lofty and sublime poetical
tradition: for example, that Aristodemus, though
ready to appease the wrath of the gods by the blood
of his own daughter,<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href="#note_622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> yet was unable to effect his purpose;
that the damsel was put to death in vain; and
upon this, recognising the will of the gods that Messenia
should fall, and being terrified by portentous
omens, he slaughtered himself upon the tomb of his
murdered child.<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623" href="#note_623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">623</span></span></a> The war seems to have been confined
chiefly to the vicinity of Ithome, which stronghold,
situated in the midst of the country, commanded
both the plain of Stenyclarus and that of the Pamisus.
The reduction of this fortress necessarily entailed the
subjugation of the whole country, and many of the
Messenians began to emigrate. With this event the
Doric colony of Rhegium is connected. Heraclides of
Pontus<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href="#note_624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a> merely relates, that some Messenians (who
happened to be at this time at Macistus in Triphylia,
in consequence of the violation of some Spartan virgins)
united themselves to the Chalcidian founders of
this town (who had been sent out from Delphi). He
probably means those Messenians who wished to make
a reparation for the violation of the Spartan virgins in
the temple of Artemis Limnatis, and were in consequence

The establishment of Tarentum is connected with
the history of the first Messenian war; but it is
wrapped up in such unintelligible fables (chiefly owing
perhaps to an ignorance of Lacedæmonian institutions),

was at that time founded from Sparta.<a id="noteref_630" name="noteref_630" href="#note_630"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">630</span></span></a>

11. In a fragment of Tyrtæus we find some very
distinct traces of the condition of the subject Messenians
after the first war, which will be separately
considered hereafter. The second war clearly broke
out in the north-eastern part of the country, on the
frontier towards Arcadia, where the ancient towns of
Andania and Œchalia were situated. In all probability
this tract of country had never been subjugated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the Spartans. Aristomenes, the hero of this war,
was born at Andania,<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href="#note_631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">631</span></span></a> from which town he harassed
the Spartans by repeated inroads and attacks. In his
first march he advanced as far as the plain of Stenyclarus;
but after the victory at the Boar's Grave he
returned to Andania. But this attempt of the Messenians
to recover their independence became of serious
importance by the share which the greater part of the
states in Peloponnesus took in it. For Strabo,<a id="noteref_632" name="noteref_632" href="#note_632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">632</span></span></a> quoting
Tyrtæus, states, that the Eleans, Argives, Arcadians,
and Pisatans<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href="#note_633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">633</span></span></a> assisted the Messenians in this
struggle. The Pisatans were led by Pantaleon the
son of Omphalion, who celebrated the 34th Olympiad in the
place of the Eleans;<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a> which fact enables us
accurately to fix the time (644 B.C.).—At the head
of the Arcadians was Aristocrates, whom Pausanias
calls a Trapezuntian, the son of Hicetas, and mentions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his treachery at the battle near the Trench, on the subsequent
discovery of which the Arcadians deprived
his family of the sovereignty of Arcadia.<a id="noteref_635" name="noteref_635" href="#note_635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">635</span></span></a> The same

quote the inscription on a pillar erected near the
mountain-altar of Zeus Lycæus in memory of the
traitor's detection. Now we know from good
authority<a id="noteref_637" name="noteref_637" href="#note_637"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">637</span></span></a>
that Aristocrates was in fact king only of Orchomenus
in Arcadia,<a id="noteref_638" name="noteref_638" href="#note_638"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a> of which his family was so far from
losing the sovereignty, that his son Aristodamus ruled
over it, and also over a great part of Arcadia. The
date of Aristocrates<a id="noteref_639" name="noteref_639" href="#note_639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">639</span></span></a> appears to have been about 680-640

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Lacedæmonians were therefore in this war
really pressed by an enemy of superior force, a fact
alluded to by Tyrtæus. Meanwhile Sparta was assisted by the
Corinthians,<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href="#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a> perhaps by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lepreatans,<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href="#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a> and
even by some ships of the Samians;<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href="#note_643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> but
chiefly by Tyrtæus of Aphidnæ, whom an absurd and
distorted fable has turned into a lame Athenian schoolmaster.
The fact of Sparta seeking a warlike minstrel
in Aphidnæ, may be accounted for from its
ancient connexions with this borough in Attica, which
is said to have been in the hands of the Dioscuri.
Whether or not Aphidnæ at that time belonged to
Attica, and was subject to Athens, is a question we
shall leave undecided; but there does not seem to be
any reason for inferring with Strabo, from the passage
of Tyrtæus itself, that the whole tradition was false,
and that Tyrtæus was a Lacedæmonian by birth,<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644" href="#note_644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a>
though he doubtless became so by adoption. It is to
be regretted that we have very little information concerning
the war carried on by Sparta with the rest of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Peloponnesians;<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href="#note_645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">645</span></span></a>
but the Messenians at a later
period withdrew from Andania towards Eira, which is
a mountain-fortress on the Neda, the border-stream
towards Arcadia, near the sea-coast. When obliged
to retire from this stronghold, they were received first
by the Arcadians, their ancient and faithful allies (who,
according to the tradition, gave them their daughters in
marriage<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href="#note_646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">646</span></span></a>); afterwards the exiles sought an asylum
with their kinsmen at Rhegium. Aristomenes himself
(if he was not put to death by the Spartans) is
said to have died at Rhodes, in the house of the noble
family of the Eratidæ.<a id="noteref_647" name="noteref_647" href="#note_647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a>

12. Besides the possession of Messenia, nothing
was of such importance to the Spartans as the influence
which they gained over the towns of Arcadia. But in
what manner these came into their hands is very little
known.<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648" href="#note_648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">648</span></span></a> During the Messenian war Arcadia was
always opposed to Sparta. Hence, in the year 659
B.C., the Spartans suddenly attacked and took the
town of Phigalea, in a corner of Messenia and Triphylia;
but were soon driven out again by the neighbouring
Oresthasians.<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href="#note_649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a> But the place chiefly dreaded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by Sparta, as being one of the most powerful cantons
in Arcadia, and commanding the principal entrance to
Laconia, was Tegea. Charilaus, one of the early
kings of Sparta, is said to have been compelled, by the
valour of the Tegeate women, to submit to a disgraceful
treaty.<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href="#note_650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a> At a later period also, in the reigns of
Eurycrates and Leon the Eurysthenid,<a id="noteref_651" name="noteref_651" href="#note_651"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">651</span></span></a> Sparta suffered

the superiority under the next king, Anaxandridas.
It was not, however, merely the ingenuity of
a mountain-tribe, in protecting and fortifying its defiles,
that made victory so difficult to the Spartans; but,
although the pass which separates Tegea from Laconia,
and even at the present time retains the vestiges of
defensive walls, was of great service in repelling invasions
from Laconia,<a id="noteref_653" name="noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a> yet Tegea was also formidable
in the open field from her heavy-armed troops, which
in later times always maintained the second place in
the allied army of Peloponnesus.<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href="#note_654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a>

13. Argos never obtained so great authority in
Argolis as Sparta did in Laconia, since, in the former
country, the Dorians divided themselves into several
ancient and considerable towns;<a id="noteref_655" name="noteref_655" href="#note_655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">655</span></span></a> and to deprive
Dorians of their independence seems to have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more contrary to the principles of that race, than to
expel them, as the Spartans did the Messenians.
Argos was thus forced to content itself with forming,
and being at the head of a league, which was to unite
the forces of the country for common defence, and to
regulate all internal affairs. An union of this kind
really existed, although it never entirely attained its
end. It was probably connected with the temple of
Apollo Pythaëus, which, as we remarked above, was
considered as common to the Epidaurians and Dryopians.
An Argive Amphictyonic council is mentioned
in the account of the Messenian war,<a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656" href="#note_656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">656</span></span></a> and is evidently
not a fiction, although erroneously there introduced.
That it still continued to exist in the 66th Olympiad is
clear from the fact, that, when the inhabitants of Sicyon
and Ægina furnished Cleomenes with ships to be
employed against Argos, each town was condemned
to pay a fine of 500 talents.<a id="noteref_657" name="noteref_657" href="#note_657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a>
These penalties could
not have been imposed by Argos as a single town,
but in the name of a confederacy, which was weakened
and injured by this act. We find that the Eleans
could impose similar penalties in the name of the
Olympian Zeus.<a id="noteref_658" name="noteref_658" href="#note_658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">658</span></span></a> But the very case here adduced
shows how refractory was the conduct of the members
of this alliance with regard to the measures taken by
the chief confederate.

14. To this internal discord were added the continual
disputes with Lacedæmon. Herodotus states,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that in ancient times (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> about the 50th Olympiad,
or 580 B.C.) the whole eastern coast of Peloponnesus
as far as Malea (comprising the towns of Prasiæ,
Cyphanta, Epidaurus Limera, and Epidelium), together
with Cythera, and the other islands, belonged
to the Argives.<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href="#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a> According to the account of Pausanias
the territory of Cynuria, a valley between two
ranges of mountains, on the frontiers of Laconia and
Argos, inhabited by a native Peloponnesian race, had
been from early times a perpetual subject of contention
between the two states. The Lacedæmonians had
subdued this district in the reigns of Echestratus and
Eurypon.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href="#note_660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a> During the reigns of Labotas and
Prytanis, the Spartans complained of an attempt of the
Argives to alienate the affections of their Periœci in
Cynuria:<a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href="#note_661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a> as, however, we know not by
what authority this statement is supported, we shall allow it to rest on
its own merits. In the reign of Charilaus the Lacedæmonians
wasted the territory of Argos.<a id="noteref_662" name="noteref_662" href="#note_662"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">662</span></span></a> His son
Nicander made an alliance with the Dryopians of
Asine against Argos. Accordingly this people were
expelled by Eratus, the Argive king, from their town,<a id="noteref_663" name="noteref_663" href="#note_663"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">663</span></span></a>
and fled to their allies in Laconia; from whom they
obtained, after the end of the first Messenian war, a
maritime district, where they built a new Asine, and
for a long time preserved their national manners,<a id="noteref_664" name="noteref_664" href="#note_664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664</span></span></a> as

15. A clearer point in the Argive and Peloponnesian
history is the reign of Pheidon. The accounts
respecting this prince having been collected and examined
in another work, it is merely necessary to
repeat the result.<a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666" href="#note_666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a> Pheidon the Argive, the
son of Aristodamidas, was descended from the royal family
of Temenus, the power of which had indeed since the
time of Medon, the son of Ceisus, been much diminished,
but yet remained in existence for a long time.
Pheidon broke through the restrictions that limited his
power, and hence, contrary however to the ancient
usage of the term, was called a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tyrant</span></span>. His views
were at first directed towards making the independent
towns of Argolis dependent upon Argos. He undertook
a war against Corinth, which he afterwards succeeded
in reducing. In all probability Epidaurus, and
certainly Ægina, belonged to him; none of the other
towns in the neighbourhood were able to withstand the
bold and determined conqueror.<a id="noteref_667" name="noteref_667" href="#note_667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">667</span></span></a>
The finishing stroke
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his achievements was manifestly the celebration of
the Olympic games, over which he, as descendant of
Hercules (the first conqueror at Olympia), after having
abolished the Ætolian-Elean Hellanodicæ, presided,
in conjunction with the inhabitants of Pisa, the
ancient town of Pelops, which at this time, and many
centuries after this time, had not relinquished its claims
to the management of the festival. This circumstance
also enables us to fix with certainty the period of his
reign, since, in the Elean registers, the 8th Olympiad
was marked as having been celebrated by him
(747 B.C.). But it was this usurpation that united
the Eleans and Lacedæmonians against him, and thus
caused his overthrow. While the undertakings of
Pheidon thus remained without benefit to his successors,
he has been denounced by posterity as the most
rapacious of tyrants in Greece; but, had he succeeded
in establishing a permanent state of affairs, he would
have received equal honours with Lycurgus. Yet,
notwithstanding his failure, some of his institutions
survived him, which adorn his memory. He is known
to have equalized all weights and measures in Peloponnesus,
which before his time were different in each
state; he was also the first who coined money. He
was enabled to undertake both with the greater success,
since the only two commercial towns at that time
belonging to Peloponnesus lay in his dominions, viz.
Corinth (whence he is sometimes called a Corinthian)
and Ægina. According to the most accurate accounts he first stamped
silver-money<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href="#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a> in Ægina
(where at that time forges doubtless existed), and, after
having circulated these, he consecrated the ancient and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then useless bars of metal to Here of Argos, where
they were exhibited in later times to strangers.<a id="noteref_669" name="noteref_669" href="#note_669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">669</span></span></a>—Many
of the most ancient drachmas of Ægina, with
the device of a tortoise, perhaps belong to this period,
since the Greek coins struck before the Peloponnesian
war appear to indicate a progress of many centuries
in the art of stamping money. Those however which
we have are sufficient to show that the same standard
was prevalent throughout Peloponnesus,<a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href="#note_670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">670</span></span></a> a difference
in weight, measure, and standard not having been introduced
till after the Peloponnesian war. This again
was a second time abolished by the Achæan league,
and an equality of measures restored.<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671" href="#note_671"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a>

took it from them before Olymp. 53. 1. 568 B.C.,<a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680" href="#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and henceforth celebrated the games of Zeus. The
Argives however again lost it; and some time before
the 80th Olympiad the Cleonæans again regulated the
festival,<a id="noteref_681" name="noteref_681" href="#note_681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">681</span></span></a> a privilege which they probably did not long
retain. It is likely that about 580 B.C. the town of
Orneæ, between Argos and Sicyon, which had anciently
carried on wars with the latter city, was
rendered subject to the former, from which circumstance
the Periœci of Argos obtained the general name
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orneatans</span></span>; to which class the Cynurians also
belonged before the battle of Thyrea.<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href="#note_682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a> But these
events properly belong to the period, on the history of
which we are now about to enter, and which we will
designate in general as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the time of the tyrants</span></span>.

1. The subject of this chapter may be best expressed
in the words of Thucydides:<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href="#note_683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“The tyrants
of Athens, and of the rest of Greece, of which many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
states had been governed by tyrants before the
Athenians, were, with the exception of those in
Sicily, in most instances, and especially in later
times, overthrown by the Lacedæmonians, whose
state was never under a despotic government, and
who, having become powerful through the early
establishment of their own constitution, were enabled
to arrange to their own liking the governments of
other states.”</span> It is a remarkable circumstance in
the history of Greece, that at the same period of time
tyrants everywhere obtained the supreme authority in
Doric, Ionic, and Æolic cities; a proof that, although
these nations were derived from different races, the
same stage in the progress of social life was every
where attended with the same phenomena. Those
states alone in which the features of the Doric character
were most strongly marked, viz., Sparta and Argos,
resisted this influence; and we shall in general find
that it was by a subversion of the Doric principles that
the tyrants obtained their power. This will be made
evident by a consideration of the absolute monarchies
in the Doric states of Peloponnesus.

2. The inhabitants of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sicyon</span></span> appear in ancient
times to have been distinguished from other Dorians
by a lively and excitable temperament, and by a
disposition which they had at an early period transferred
to their mythical hero Adrastus, whose <span class="tei tei-q">“tongue
was softly persuasive.”</span><a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href="#note_684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a> This very disposition,
however, under the actual state of circumstances,
opened the way to tyranny. In this instance of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sicyon, as in many others, the tyrant was the leader
of the lower classes, who were opposed to the aristocracy.
It was in this character that Orthagoras came
forward, who, not being of an ancient family, was
called by the nobles a cook.<a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685" href="#note_685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a> But, notwithstanding
its low origin, the family of this person maintained
the supremacy for a longer period than any other,
according to Aristotle<a id="noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href="#note_686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a> for a century, as they
did not maltreat the citizens, and upon the whole respected
the laws. Their succession is Orthagoras, Andreas,
Myron, Aristonymus, and Cleisthenes,<a id="noteref_687" name="noteref_687" href="#note_687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> of whom, however,
the second and fourth never ascended the throne,
or only reigned for a short time. Myron was conqueror
at Olympia in the chariot-race in the 33d
Olympiad (648 B. C), and afterwards built a treasury,
in which two apartments were inlaid with Tartessian
brass, and adorned with Doric and Ionic
columns.<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href="#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a> Both the architectural orders employed in
this building, and the Tartessian brass, which the
Phocæans had then brought to Greece in large quantities from the
hospitable king Arganthonius,<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href="#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a> attest
the intercourse of Myron with the Asiatics; we shall
presently see that this same correspondence was of
considerable importance for the measures of other
tyrants. Cleisthenes appears to have employed violence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in obtaining the sovereignty,<a id="noteref_690" name="noteref_690" href="#note_690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> which he held
undisturbed, partly by creating terror through his
military fame and exploits in arms, and partly by
gaining the support of the people by the introduction
of some democratic elements into the constitution.
With regard to the latter measure, the singular
alterations which he made in the tribes of Sicyon
will be explained hereafter.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a> We will here
only remark that Cleisthenes himself belonged to the subject
tribe, which was not of Doric origin; and while
he endeavoured to raise the latter, at the same time
he sought to depress, and even to dishonour the
Doric tribes, so that he entirely destroyed and reversed
the whole state of things which had previously
existed. For this reason Cleisthenes was at enmity with Argos,
the chief Doric city of this district.<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href="#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a>
For the same reason he proscribed the worship of
the Argive hero Adrastus, and favoured in its place
the worship of Dionysus, a deity foreign to the Doric
character; and lastly, prohibited the Homeric rhapsodists
from entering the town, because Homer had
celebrated Argos, and, we may add, an aristocratic
form of government. These characteristic traits of
a bold and comprehensive mind are gathered from
the lively narrative of Herodotus. The same political
tendency was inherited by his son-in-law Megacles,
the husband of the beautiful Agariste, to
obtain whose hand many rival youths had assembled
in the palace of Cleisthenes, like the suitors of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
old, for that of Helen;<a id="noteref_693" name="noteref_693" href="#note_693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a> and it was particularly manifested
in Cleisthenes of Athens, who changed the
Athenian constitution by abolishing the last traces of
separate ranks. With regard, however, to the warlike
actions of Cleisthenes, he must have been very
celebrated for his prowess; since in the war of the
Amphictyons against Cirrha, although denounced as a
stone-slinger (that is, a man of the lowest rank),<a id="noteref_694" name="noteref_694" href="#note_694"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">694</span></span></a> by
the Pythian priestess, he shared the chief command
of the army with the Thessalian Heraclid, Eurylochus,
and helped to conquer the city.<a id="noteref_695" name="noteref_695" href="#note_695"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">695</span></span></a> This took place in the
third year of the 47th Olympiad, or 592 B.C.<a id="noteref_696" name="noteref_696" href="#note_696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">696</span></span></a>
Out of the plunder of the town Cleisthenes built a portico
for the embellishment of Sicyon;<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="#note_697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a> he was also
conqueror in the chariot-race at the second Pythiad (Olymp.
49. 3. 584 B.C.)<a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href="#note_698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a> It may perhaps be possible
from the scattered accounts concerning this prince
to form a notion of his character. Cleisthenes was
undoubtedly a man who was able to seize the spirit of
the time, which aimed at great liberty and excitement—the
very contrary of the settled composure
of the Dorians; and, combining talents and versatility
with the love of splendour and pageantry, ridiculed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
many things hitherto looked upon with awe, and set
no limits to his love of change. Notwithstanding
these qualities, he was, as is probable from the general
testimony of Thucydides, overthrown by Sparta, perhaps
soon after 580 B.C.;<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699" href="#note_699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">699</span></span></a> nor was the ancient state of things
restored at Sicyon till 60 years afterwards,<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href="#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a>
during which interval another tyrant named Æschines
reigned, belonging however to a different family.

3. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Corinthian</span></span>
tyrants<a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href="#note_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a> were nearly allied
with those of Sicyon; since the former, not belonging
to the Doric nobility, were placed in the same
situation as the latter with regard to this class. In
Corinth, before the commencement of the dynasty of
tyrants, the ruling power was held by the numerous<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href="#note_702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">702</span></span></a>
Heraclide clan of the Bacchiadæ, which had changed
the original constitution into an oligarchy, by keeping
itself distinct, in the manner of a caste, from all
other families, and alone furnished the city with the
annual prytanes, the chief magistrates. Cypselus the
son of Aëtion, the grandson of Echecrates, from a
Corinthian borough named Petra,<a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href="#note_703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">703</span></span></a> and not of Doric
descent, although connected on his mother's side with
the Bacchiadæ, overcame, with the assistance again of
the lower classes,<a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href="#note_704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a> the oligarchs, now become odious
through their luxury<a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705" href="#note_705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">705</span></span></a> and insolence, the
larger part of whom, either voluntarily or by compulsion, quitted
Corinth;<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> and Cypselus became tyrant about the 30th
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Olympiad (660 B.C.),<a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href="#note_707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">707</span></span></a> from the inability of the
people to govern itself independently. However violently
the Corinthian orator in Herodotus accuses this
prince, the judgment of antiquity in general was
widely different. Cypselus was of a peaceable disposition,
reigned without a body-guard,<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708" href="#note_708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a> and never
forgot that he rose from a demagogue to the throne.
He also undertook works of building, either from a
taste for the arts, or for the purpose of employing the
people. The treasury at Delphi, together with the
plane-tree, was his work.<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709" href="#note_709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a> To him succeeded his son
Periander, who was at first equally or more mild than
his father.<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href="#note_710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">710</span></span></a> Soon, however, his conduct became sensibly
more violent, and, according to Herodotus, he
was instigated by his correspondence with Thrasybulus,
the tyrant of Miletus, who counselled him by every
method to weaken, or even to exterminate, the nobility
of his city.<a id="noteref_711" name="noteref_711" href="#note_711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">711</span></span></a> Many of his actions were evidently
prompted by the wish of utterly eradicating the peculiarities
of the Doric race, which were closely connected
with an aristocratic spirit. For this reason he
abolished the public tables, and prohibited the ancient
education.<a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712" href="#note_712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a> He awed the people by his
military splendour, and maintained triremes on both coasts of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Isthmus;<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href="#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a> his person he protected by three
hundred body-guards.<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> To maintain the city at peace, and to
avoid all violent commotions, was a principle, on the
observance of which the security of his dominion depended,
and upon which a complete system of regulations
was founded. With this view he abolished a
criminal court<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a> for the condemnation of such as wasted
their patrimony, inasmuch as persons in this situation
were likely to become innovators. He interdicted
immoderate luxury, and an extravagant number of
slaves. Idleness he considered as especially dangerous.
So little true did he remain to the democratic
principles of his father, that he expelled the people
from the city;<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a> and in order the more readily to
accustom them to agricultural and mechanical labour, only permitted
them to wear the dress of peasants.<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href="#note_717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a>
His own expenses were trifling, and therefore he required
no other taxes than harbour-dues and market-tolls.
He also avoided, where his projects did not
require it, all violence and open injustice; and was even
at times so strict a maintainer of public morality, that
the numerous procuresses of the luxurious Corinth
were by his orders thrown into the sea;<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href="#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> the hospitable
damsels of Aphrodite<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href="#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a>
being protected by religion.
He, as well as his father, made the construction of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
splendid monuments of art<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href="#note_720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a> a means of taxing the
property of the rich, and of employing the body of the
people; though indeed his own refined taste took
pleasure in such works. And in general, if considered
in reference to the cultivation of taste and intellect,
and the interests of agriculture and trade, the age of
the tyrants was productive of a very great advancement
in the Grecian states. The unpliant disposition,
strict in the observance of all ancient customs and
usages, was then first bent and subdued, and more
liberal and extended views became prevalent. The
tyrants were frequently in intimate connexion with the
inhabitants of Asia Minor, whom Sparta despised for
their luxury and effeminacy; and from the Lydian
sultan in his harem at Sardes, a chain of communication,
most important in its consequences, was established
through the princes of Miletus and Samos
with the countries in the immediate neighbourhood of
Sparta. Periander was in correspondence not only
with Thrasybulus, but also with Halyattes, the king of
Lydia, and sent to the latter prince some Corcyræan youths to be
castrated according to the oriental custom.<a id="noteref_721" name="noteref_721" href="#note_721"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">721</span></span></a>
The names of his kinsmen, Psammetichus and
Gordias, the latter Phrygian, the former Egyptian, are
proofs of an hospitable intercourse with those countries.
On the other side of Greece, the policy of the Cypselidæ
led them to attempt the occupation of the coast
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Ionian sea as far as Illyria, and to establish a
connexion with the barbarous nations of the interior.<a id="noteref_722" name="noteref_722" href="#note_722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">722</span></span></a>
Periander was of a daring and comprehensive spirit,
and rivalled by few of his contemporaries, bold in the
field, politic in council, though misled by continual
distrust to undertake unworthy measures, and having
too little regard for the good of the people when it interfered
with his own designs; a friend of the arts, of
an enlightened mind, but at the same time overcome
by the strength of his passions; and, although devoid
of awe for all sacred things, yet at times a prey to the
most grovelling superstition. After the death of Periander,
Psammetichus<a id="noteref_723" name="noteref_723" href="#note_723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">723</span></span></a> the son of Gordias, of the same
family, succeeded to the sovereignty, but only reigned
three years, having been, without doubt, overthrown by
the Spartans in Olymp. 49. 3. 582 B.C.<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href="#note_724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">724</span></span></a>

4. Periander was married to the fair Melissa, whose
beauty had captivated him in the house of her father,
the tyrant Procles, while she was distributing wine to the labourers
in a thin Doric dress.<a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href="#note_725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a> Procles was
ruler of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epidaurus</span></span> and the island of Ægina, which
were at that time still closely united; he himself was
related by marriage to the princes of Orchomenus,
and appears from this circumstance, and from his connexion
with the family of Cypselus, to belong to the
number of tyrants, who, being hostile to the Dorian
aristocracy, obtained their power by the assistance of
the lower ranks.

resembled the princes already mentioned in his
conduct (since he likewise obtained his power by attacking

like the others he endeavoured to please the people by
embellishing the city, by the construction of an aqueduct,
and of a beautiful fountain;<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> it is easy to perceive
in the dynasties of the Sicyonian, Corinthian,
Epidaurian, and Megarian tyrants, a powerful coalition
against the supremacy of the Dorians, and the
ancient principles of that race, the more powerful, as
they knew how to render subservient to their own
ends the opinions which had lately arisen; and it is a
matter of wonder that Sparta should have succeeded
in overthrowing this combination.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Asia, and also Athens, together with Phocis, Thessaly,
and the colonies in Sicily and Italy, were all in
the hands of tyrants, who doubtless assisted one another,
and knew their common interest; and that
Sparta alone, in most instances at the instigation of
the Delphian oracle, declared against all these rulers
a lasting war, and in fact overthrew them all, with the
exception of the Sicilian tyrants; it must be confessed,
that in this period of Grecian history no contest took
place either greater, or, by its extent as well as its
principles, of more important political and moral consequences.
The following tyrants are stated by ancient
historians to have been deposed by the Spartans:<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a>
the Cypselidæ of Corinth and Ambracia, the former
in Olymp. 49. 3. (584 B.C.), the latter probably
somewhat later; the Pisistratidæ of Athens, who were
allied with the Thessalians, in Olymp. 67. 3. (510
B.C.);<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a>
their adherent Lygdamis of Naxos,<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> probably
about the same time: Æschines of Sicyon, about the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Aulis of Phocis; and Aristogenes of Miletus, of whom we know only
the names;<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a> the larger number were
dethroned under the kings Anaxandridas and Ariston,
Cleomenes and Demaratus. Of these tyrants, some
they deposed by a military force, as the Pisistratidæ;
but frequently, as Plutarch says, they overthrew the
despotism without <span class="tei tei-q">“moving a shield,”</span> by despatching
a herald, whom all immediately obeyed, <span class="tei tei-q">“as, when the
queen bee appears, the rest arrange themselves in
order.”</span><a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href="#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> In the time of Cleomenes also (525 B.C.)
Sparta sent out a great armament, together with Corinthian
and other allies, against Polycrates of Samos,
the first Doric expedition against Asia, not, as is evident
from the trivial reason stated by Herodotus, (viz.
in order to revenge the plunder of a cauldron and a
breastplate,) but with the intent of following up their
principle of deposing all tyrants.<a id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> But the besieging
of a fortified town, situated upon the sea, and at so
great a distance, was beyond the strength of Peloponnesus.
The last expedition of Sparta against the
tyrants falls after the Persian war, when king Leotychidas,
the conqueror at Mycale, was sent for the
purpose of ejecting the Aleuadæ of Thessaly, who had
delivered up the country to the Persians in 470 B.C.
or somewhat later. Aristomedes and Angelus were
actually dethroned, but the king suffering himself to
be bribed by others, the expedition did not completely
succeed.<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href="#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a>

6. To these important changes in the political history
of that time we may annex the subordinate events
in the interior of Peloponnesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sparta, by the conquest of Cynuria, had obtained
the key of the Argive territory. Soon after this,
Cleomenes, the eldest son of Anaxandridas the
Eurysthenid, succeeded to the throne, a man of great
boldness and strength of mind, sagacious, enterprising,
accustomed, after the manner of his age and country,
to express himself in a concise and emphatic language,
only too much inflated by family and personal pride,
and in disposition more nearly resembling his contemporaries
the tyrants than beseemed a king of
Sparta. The first exploit of this prince<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> was the expedition
against Argos. He landed in some vessels of
Sicyon and Ægina on the coast of Tiryns, overcame
the Argives at the wood of Argos,<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href="#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a> slew the greater
part of the men able to bear arms, and would have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
succeeded in capturing their city, had he not, from an
inconceivable superstition, dismissed the allied army
without making any further use of the victory, and
contented himself with sacrificing in the temple of
Here.<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> At the same time Argos, in consequence of
this defeat, remained for a long time crippled, and it
was even necessary that a complete change in her
political condition should take place, in order to renovate
the feeble and disordered state into which she had
fallen.

had for a time governed the state thus deprived of its
free inhabitants, until the young men who had in the
mean time arisen to manhood overcame and expelled
them, the Argives, as Aristotle<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a> relates, saw themselves
compelled, in order to restore the numbers of
their free population, to collect about them the surrounding
subjects of their city, the Periœci, and to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The completion of this plan took place one generation
after the fatal battle with Cleomenes, at the time of
the Persian war, in which Argos, whose attention was
wholly occupied with strengthening her affairs at
home, took no part. At that time the Argives, in
order to increase their own numbers, dispeopled nearly
all the large cities in the surrounding country, and
transplanted the inhabitants to Argos;<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href="#note_745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">745</span></span></a>
particularly Tiryns, Mycenæ, Hyseæ, Orneæ, and
Midea.<a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href="#note_746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a> Tiryns
and Mycenæ were in the time of the Persian war free,
and even independent communities, which followed
the command of Sparta without the consent of Argos;
the latter town indeed contested with Argos the right
to the administration of the temple of Here, and the
presidency at the Nemean games.<a id="noteref_747" name="noteref_747" href="#note_747"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">747</span></span></a> The destruction
of their city, which the Argives undertook in concert
with the Cleonæans and Tegeates,<a id="noteref_748" name="noteref_748" href="#note_748"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">748</span></span></a> was effected in the
year 464 B.C. (Olymp. 79. 1). But of the Mycenæans,
a few only followed the Argives, as the larger
number either took refuge at Cleonæ (which city was
at that time independent, and had for some time the
management of the Nemean
games)<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a>, at Ceryneia in

also some fled to Epidaurus, and some to Halieis in
the territory of the Dryopians, in which place the
expelled Hermioneans also found an asylum.<a id="noteref_751" name="noteref_751" href="#note_751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a> For
Hermione, which Herodotus during the time of the
Persian war considers as a Dryopian city,<a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752" href="#note_752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">752</span></span></a> was subsequently
taken by the Argives.<a id="noteref_753" name="noteref_753" href="#note_753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">753</span></span></a> The other cities
which have been mentioned, had however, as we know
of Orneæ and also Hysiæ, previously belonged to
Periœci, being subjects of Argos, and were only then incorporated
for the purpose of enlarging the metropolis.<a id="noteref_754" name="noteref_754" href="#note_754"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">754</span></span></a>
The Argives, by these arbitrary proceedings,
secured themselves as well against external foes as
against their former enemies the bond-slaves, and also
acquired a large number of laborious and industrious
inhabitants, who, by the continuance of peace, soon
re-established the prosperity and wealth of Argos.<a id="noteref_755" name="noteref_755" href="#note_755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">755</span></span></a>
The oracle has well marked out the principles which
were then expedient for the welfare of that state, when
it recommended it, as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the enemy of its neighbours,
and friend of the gods, to draw in its arms, and

At the same time, however, by these proceedings, a complete change
in the constitution was brought about, and Argos, as
we shall see hereafter, gradually lost the peculiar
features of the Doric character.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

8. It is remarkable that during this whole time,
in which Sparta founded her empire, we read of no
serious contest between Dorians and Ionians. For
although the border-states, Megara and Ægina (the
latter after its revolt from Epidaurus), carried on a
continued war with Athens, the whole race took no
part in the contest, and Sparta herself fulfilled the
office of an impartial arbitrator between Athens and
Megara. Even before the time of Solon, the Athenians and
Megarians fought in the territory of Eleusis.<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757" href="#note_757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">757</span></span></a>
The chief struggle was for the island of Salamis,
which Solon is supposed to have gained by the well
known stratagem,<a id="noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="#note_758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a> a fact however which was denied by
Daimachus of Platæa.<a id="noteref_759" name="noteref_759" href="#note_759"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">759</span></span></a> According to the Megarian
account, some refugees from their own city (named Δορύκλειοι)
betrayed the island to the Athenians.<a id="noteref_760" name="noteref_760" href="#note_760"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">760</span></span></a>
So much is certain, that five Spartan arbitrators
(Critolaidas, Amompharetus, Hypsechidas, Anaxilas,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Cleomenes), in obedience to ancient traditions and
fables respecting the original owners of Salamis, adjudged
the possession of Salamis to the Athenians.
Yet in the troubles which succeeded the banishment
of Megacles, this island was again lost, as well as the
harbour Nisæa, which had been before conquered.<a id="noteref_761" name="noteref_761" href="#note_761"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">761</span></span></a>
They soon however regained it, and Megara appears
from that time forth to have given up all hopes of recovery:
as in this age the power of Athens increased
so rapidly, that Megara could no longer think of renewing
her ancient contests.

Since it is not my object to give a continuous and
general narration of facts, but only to extract what is
most instructive for the condition of the Doric race, I
shall not carry on the history of the Dorians out of
Peloponnesus to a lower point, as their local connexions
would lead us far astray into other regions.
For the same reason I will only touch upon a few events
of the Persian wars, confining myself to the internal
affairs of Peloponnesus during that period, among
which the supremacy of Sparta is the most important

1. Sparta, by the conquest of Messenia and Tegea,
had obtained the first rank in Peloponnesus, which
character she confirmed by the expulsion of the tyrants,
and the overthrow of Argos. From about the year
580 B.C. she acted as the recognised commander,
not only of Peloponnesus, but of the whole Greek
name. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">confederacy</span></span> itself however was formed
by the inhabitants of that peninsula alone, on fixed and
regular laws; whereas the other Greeks only annexed
themselves to it temporarily. The order of precedence
observed by the members of this league may be taken
from the inscription on the footstool of the statue of
Zeus, which was dedicated at Olympia after the
Persian war, the Ionians, who were only allied for a
time, being omitted.<a id="noteref_762" name="noteref_762" href="#note_762"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">762</span></span></a> It is as follows: Lacedæmon,

Corinth, Sicyon, Ægina, Megara, Epidaurus,<a id="noteref_763" name="noteref_763" href="#note_763"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a> Tegea,
Orchomenus, Phlius, Trœzen, Hermione, Tiryns,
Mycenæ, Lepreum, and Elis; which state was contented
with the last place, on account of the small
share which it had taken in the war. The defenders of the
Isthmus are enumerated in the following order;<a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href="#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a>
Lacedæmonians, Arcadians, Eleans, Corinthians, Sicyonians,
Epidaurians, Phliasians, Trœzenians, and
Hermionians, nearly agreeing with the other list, only
that the Arcadians, having been present with their
whole force, and also the Eleans, occupy an earlier
place; and the Megarians and Æginetans are omitted,
as having had no share in the defence. This regular
order of precedence is alone a proof of a firm union.
The Tegeates, since they had joined the side of Lacedæmon,
enjoyed several privileges, and especially the place of honour
at the left wing of the allied army.<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href="#note_765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a>
Argos remained excluded from the nations of Peloponnesus,
as it never would submit to the command of

only joined themselves momentarily to the alliance:<a id="noteref_766" name="noteref_766" href="#note_766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a>

could be collected by a simple summons. But
agricultural labour, festivals, and the natural slowness
of the Doric race, often very much retarded the assembling
of this army. The contributions, chiefly
perhaps voluntary, both of states and individuals, were
registered on stone: and there is still extant an inscription
found at Tegea, in which the war supplies of the
Ephesians, Melians, &amp;c, in money and in corn, are
recorded.<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a> But the Lacedæmonians never exacted
from the Peloponnesian confederacy a regular annual
contribution, independent of circumstances; which
would have been in fact a tribute: a measure of this
kind being once proposed to king Archidamus, he
answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“that war did not consume according to
rule.<a id="noteref_781" name="noteref_781" href="#note_781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">781</span></span></a>”</span> Pericles, however, properly considers it as a
disadvantage to the Peloponnesians that they had no
paid troops, and that neither in common nor in the
several states they had amassed any treasure.<a id="noteref_782" name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a> The
object of an expedition was publicly declared: occasionally
however, when secrecy was required, it was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
known neither to the states nor to their army.<a id="noteref_783" name="noteref_783" href="#note_783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a> The

is not clear to what extent this call was binding upon
them. The Spartan military constitution, which we
will explain hereafter, extended to the whole allied
army; but it was doubtless variously combined with
the tactics of the several nations.<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785" href="#note_785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a> To the council of
war, which moreover only debated, and did not decide,
the Spartan king summoned the leaders of the several
states, together with other commanders, and generally
the most distinguished persons in the army.<a id="noteref_786" name="noteref_786" href="#note_786"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">786</span></span></a>

3. According to the constitution of the Peloponnesian
league, every common action, such as a declaration
of war, or the conclusion of a peace or treaty, was
agreed on at a congress of the confederates. But, as
there was no regular assembly of this kind, the several
states sent envoys (ἄγγελοι), like the deputies (πρόβουλοι)
of the Ionians, who generally remained together
only for a short time.<a id="noteref_787" name="noteref_787" href="#note_787"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a> All the members had

respecting the exact state of the confederacy; it is
probable indeed, from the aristocratic feelings of the
Peloponnesians, that, upon the whole, authority had
more weight than numbers; and for great undertakings,
such as the Peloponnesian war, the assent of the
chief state was necessary, in addition to the agreement
of the other confederates.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href="#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a> When the congress was

they naturally withdrew during the division. Of these
envoys, besides Sosicles the Corinthian, we also know
the name of Chileus of Tegea, who prevailed upon the

4. But upon the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em> affairs, laws, and institutions
of the allied states, the confederacy had legally
no influence. It was a fundamental law that
every state (πόλις) should, according to its ancient
customs (καττὰ πάτρια), be independent and sovereign
(αὐτόνομος καὶ αὐτόπολις);<a id="noteref_794" name="noteref_794" href="#note_794"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">794</span></span></a> and it is much to the
credit of Sparta, that, so long as the league was in
existence, she never, not even when a favourable
opportunity offered, deprived any Peloponnesian state
of this independence. Nor were disputes between
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
individual states brought before the congress of the
allies, which, on account of the preponderance of
Sparta, would have endangered their liberty; but they
were commonly either referred to the Delphian oracle, or to arbitrators
chosen by both states.<a id="noteref_795" name="noteref_795" href="#note_795"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">795</span></span></a> When Elis
claimed an ancient tribute from Lepreum, both states
agreed to make Sparta their arbitrator by a special
reference. In this character Sparta declared that
Lepreum, being an independent member of the confederacy,
was not bound to pay the tribute: and Elis
acted unjustly in refusing to abide by her agreement,
on the plea that she had not expected the decision.<a id="noteref_796" name="noteref_796" href="#note_796"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a>
For disputes between citizens of different states there
was an entirely free and equal intercourse of justice
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">commercium juris dandi repetendique</span></span>).<a id="noteref_797" name="noteref_797" href="#note_797"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">797</span></span></a> The jurisdiction
of the states was also absolutely exempt from
foreign interference (αὐτόδικοι).<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798" href="#note_798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">798</span></span></a> These are the chief
features of the constitution of the Peloponnesian confederacy;
the only one which in the flourishing times
of Greece combined extensive powers with justice, and
a respect for the independence of its weaker members.

5. Sparta had not become the head of this league
by agreement, and still less by usurpation; but by tacit
acknowledgment she was the leader, not only of this,
but of the whole of Greece; and she acted as such in
all foreign relations from about the year 580 B.C.
Her alliance was courted by Crœsus: and the Ionians,
when pressed by Cyrus, had recourse to the Spartans,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who, with an amusing ignorance of the state of affairs
beyond the sea, thought to terrify the king of Persia
by the threat of hostilities. It is a remarkable fact,
that there were at that time Scythian envoys in Sparta,
with whom a great plan of operations against Persia
is said to have been concerted; which it is not easy to
believe.<a id="noteref_799" name="noteref_799" href="#note_799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">799</span></span></a> In the year 520 B.C. the Platæans put
themselves under the protection of Cleomenes,<a id="noteref_800" name="noteref_800" href="#note_800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">800</span></span></a> who
referred them to Athens; a herald from Sparta drove

the national enemy: and when the Æginetans gave the
Persians earth and water, the Athenians accused them
of treachery before the Spartans: and lastly, during
the Persian war, Greece found in the high character
of that state the only means of effecting the union so
necessary for her safety and success.<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a>

6. In this war a new confederacy was formed,
which was extended beyond Peloponnesus; the community
of danger and of victory having, besides a
momentary combination, also produced an union destined
for some duration. It was the assembly of this
league—a fixed congress at Corinth during, and at
Sparta after, the war—that settled the internal differences
of Greece, that invited Argos, Corcyra, and
Gelon to join the league, and afterwards called upon
Themistocles to answer for his proceedings.<a id="noteref_804" name="noteref_804" href="#note_804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">804</span></span></a> So much

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time Pausanias, the regent of Sparta, after the great
victory of Platæa (at which, according to Æschylus,
the power of Persia fell by the Doric spear),<a id="noteref_805" name="noteref_805" href="#note_805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">805</span></span></a>
prevailed upon the allies to conclude a further treaty. Under the
auspices of the gods of the confederacy, particularly
of the Eleutherian (or Grecian) Zeus, they pledged
themselves mutually to maintain the independence of
all states, and to many other conditions, of which the
memory has been lost. To the Platæans in particular
security from danger was promised.<a id="noteref_806" name="noteref_806" href="#note_806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">806</span></span></a>

confederacy.<a id="noteref_807" name="noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The splendid victories over the Persians had for
some time taken Sparta, which was fitted for a quiet
and passive existence, out of her natural sphere; and
her king Pausanias had wished to betray his country
for the glitter of an Asiatic prince. But this state
soon perceived her true interest, and sent no more
commanders to Asia, <span class="tei tei-q">“that her generals might not be
made worse:”</span> she likewise decided to avoid any
further war with the Persians, thinking that Athens
was better fitted to carry it on than herself.<a id="noteref_808" name="noteref_808" href="#note_808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">808</span></span></a>
The decision of the Spartans was doubtless influenced by the
defection of the Ionians from Pausanias, and their
refusal to obey Dorcis, whom the Spartans had sent
with a small body of men in his place. Nevertheless,
the chief motives which determined them must have
lain deeper; for without the Greeks of Asia Minor,
they could, by the assistance of the naval powers of
Peloponnesus, Corinth, Ægina, &amp;c, have continued a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
war which promised more gain and plunder than
trouble and danger. If the speech were now extant in
which Hetoëmaridas the Heraclid proved to the councillors
that it was not expedient for Sparta to aim at
the mastery of the sea,<a id="noteref_809" name="noteref_809" href="#note_809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">809</span></span></a> we should doubtless
possess a profound view, on the Spartan side, of those things
which we are now accustomed to look on with Athenian
eyes. Nor is it true that the supremacy over the
Greeks was in fact transferred at all from Sparta to
Athens, if we consider the matter as Sparta considered
it, however great the influence of this change may have
been on the power of Athens. But Sparta continued
to hold her pre-eminence in Peloponnesus, and most
of the nations of the mother-country joined themselves
to her: while none but the Greeks of Asia Minor and
the islands, who had previously been subjects of Persia,
and were then only partially liberated, perhaps too
much despised by Sparta, put themselves under the
command of Athens.<a id="noteref_810" name="noteref_810" href="#note_810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. But the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete</span></em> liberation of Asia Minor from
the Persian yoke, which has been considered one of the
chief exploits of Athens, was in fact never effected.
Without entering into the discussion respecting the
problematical treaty of Cimon,<a id="noteref_811" name="noteref_811" href="#note_811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">811</span></span></a> we will merely seek
to ascertain the actual state of the Asiatic Greeks at
this period. Herodotus states, that Artaphernes, the
satrap at Sardes under Darius, fixed the tribute to be
paid by the Ionians as it remained until the time of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
writer,<a id="noteref_812" name="noteref_812" href="#note_812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">812</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> about the end of the Peloponnesian war.
It is evident that this was a tribute to be paid to the
king of Persia: the exactions of the Athenians were
clearly not regulated by any Persian register of property.
Again, in the nineteenth year of the war,
Tissaphernes sought for assistance against Athens, that
he might be able to pay to the king of Persia the tribute
due from the Grecian maritime towns, which the
Athenians had prevented him from collecting.<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href="#note_813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a> From
this it is plain that the shah of Susa was ignorant that
the majority of those cities had for more than sixty
years paid to the Athenians and not to him, and attributed
the arrears only to the negligence of his viceroys.
I say only the majority; for the Athenians had been
far from completing the glorious work of the great
Cimon; and after the war-contributions had become
a most oppressive tribute, these cities might not themselves
be very desirous to change their master. Hence
Themistocles, as a vassal of Persia, possessed undisturbed,
at the accession of Artaxerxes, the beautiful
towns of Magnesia on the Mæander, Lampsacus,
Myus, Percote, and ancient Scepsis.<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href="#note_814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a> At a still later
period the descendants of king Demaratus, Eurysthenes,
and Procles, ruled by the same title over Halisarna
in Mysia.<a id="noteref_815" name="noteref_815" href="#note_815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a> The neighbouring towns of Gambrium,
Palægambrium, Myrina, and Grynium had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been given by Darius to Gongylus, and his descendants
still dwelt there after the Peloponnesian war.<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a>
When Athens unjustly expelled the Delians from
their island, they found a place of refuge at Adramytteum,
on the coast of Æolis, which was granted them
by the satrap Pharnaces.<a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> Thus the Athenian empire
did not prevent the vassals and subjects of the king of
Persia from ruling over the Greeks of Asia Minor,
even down to the very coast. We need not go any
further to prove the entire falsehood of the account commonly
given by the panegyrical rhetoricians of Athens.

9. Peloponnesus took the less concern in these
proceedings, as internal differences had arisen from
some unknown cause, which led to an open war between
Sparta and Arcadia. We only know, that,
between the battle of Platæa (in which Tegea, as also
later still, showed great fidelity towards Sparta) and
the war with the Helots (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> between 479 and 465
B.C.), the Lacedæmonians fought two great battles,
the one against the Tegeates and Argives at Tegea,
the other against all the Arcadians, with the exception
of the Mantineans, at Dipæa in the Mænalian territory.
Tisamenus, an Elean, of the family of the
Iamidæ, was in both battles in the Spartan army; and
in both Sparta was victorious.<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href="#note_818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a> Yet, in an epigram

we find that Argos had a share in this war,<a id="noteref_820" name="noteref_820" href="#note_820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a> it is possible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the views of that state were directed against
the ascendancy of Sparta; perhaps also the independence
of the Mænalians, Parrhasians, &amp;c. had been,
as was so often the case, attacked by the more powerful
states of Arcadia, and was defended by the head of
the Peloponnesian confederacy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. This war had not been brought to a termination,
when, in the year 465 B.C., in the reign of
Archidamus<a id="noteref_821" name="noteref_821" href="#note_821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">821</span></span></a> and Pleistoanax, a tremendous earthquake
(which is said to have been predicted by Anaximander<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href="#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a>)
destroyed Sparta, and a sudden ruin threatened
to overwhelm the state of Greece. For, in the
hope of utterly annihilating their rulers, many Helots
(perhaps doubly excited by the late outrage on the
suppliants at the altar of the Tænarian god),<a id="noteref_823" name="noteref_823" href="#note_823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a> especially
the ancient inhabitants of Messenia, and two
cities of the Periœci, revolted from Sparta; these
rebels were all named Messenians, and the war was
called the third Messenian war.<a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="#note_824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a> The circumstances
of this terrible contest are almost unknown to us; and
we can only collect the few fragments extant of its
history. Aëimnestus the Spartan, who had killed
Mardonius, fought with 300 men at Stenyclarus
against a body of Messenians, and was slain with all
his men.<a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825" href="#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a> This was followed by a great battle with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the same enemy at Ithome,<a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href="#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> in which the Spartans
were victorious. Most of the conquered Messenians
then intrenched themselves on the steep summit of
Ithome, which was even then sacred to Zeus Ithomatas;
and they probably restored the ancient walls
and defences which had fallen down. Upon this the
Lacedæmonians, foreseeing a tedious siege, called in
the aid of their allies; and this call was answered
among others by the Æginetans,<a id="noteref_827" name="noteref_827" href="#note_827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a> the Mantineans,<a id="noteref_828" name="noteref_828" href="#note_828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a>

their suspicion of the innovating spirit of their ally.<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href="#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a>
In the tenth year of the siege, 455 B.C., Ithome surrendered
on terms; and the Messenians, together with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their wives and children, quitted Peloponnesus, under
a promise of never again entering it. It appears that
the war between Lacedæmon and Arcadia was concluded
upon conditions, of which one was, that no person
should be put to death for the sake of the Lacedæmonian
party at Tegea; and another, that Sparta
was to expel the Messenians from the country, but
not kill them—which were inscribed on a pillar on
the banks of the Alpheus.<a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832" href="#note_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> The Athenians, however,
gave the fugitives the town of Naupactus, which they
had shortly before conquered, and which was conveniently
situated for tempting them, against their promise,
to make inroads and forays in Peloponnesus.
The Messenians still continued, in the Peloponnesian
war, to be distinguished from the neighbouring people
by their Doric dialect.<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href="#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. Immediately after the dismission of the Athenians
from Ithome, the people of Athens, in order to
resent the affront, annulled the alliance with Sparta,
which had subsisted since the Persian war;<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834" href="#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a> entered
into a treaty with Argos, the enemy of Sparta, and
also with the Thessalians; and even joined to itself
Megara, which was dependent on its commercial intercourse.
Then followed the war with the maritime
towns of Argolis, in which Athens, after many reverses,
at length succeeded in destroying the fleet of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Ægina, and subjugating that island (457 B.C.).<a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href="#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a>
Sparta was compelled to be a quiet spectator of the
subjection of so important a member of her confederacy,
as she was still occupied with the siege of Ithome,
and in the same year had sent out an army to liberate
her mother country, Doris, from the yoke of the Phocians.
But when, after the execution of this object,
the Spartans were hastening back to Peloponnesus,
they were compelled to force their passage home by
the battle of Tanagra, which, with the assistance of
the Thebans, they gained over an army composed of
Athenians, Ionians, Argives, and Thessalians. This
aid was afforded to them on the condition that they
would help the Thebans to regain their supremacy in
Bœotia, which the Thebans had lost by their defection
from the Grecian cause in the Persian war.<a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836" href="#note_836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a> Sparta,
however, after so decisive a victory, concluded a four
months' armistice with Athens, during which that
state conquered the Thebans at Œnophyta, finished
the blockade of Ægina, subdued all Bœotia with the
exception of Thebes, and Phocis, and extended its
democratical constitution, which after the battle of
Tanagra was nearly threatened with destruction,<a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837" href="#note_837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a> even
to the city of Thebes. The inactivity of Sparta during
these astonishing successes of her enemy (for when
she concluded the armistice with Athens she must
have partly foreseen its consequences) seems to prove
that she was entirely occupied with the final capture
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Ithome, and the settlement of her interests in
Arcadia.<a id="noteref_838" name="noteref_838" href="#note_838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">838</span></span></a>
But that the war, which was now renewed
by Athens, nevertheless extended to the whole Peloponnesian
league, is shown by the connected attacks
of Tolmides on the Spartan harbour Gytheium, and
the cities of Sicyon and Corinth, and also by the expedition
of Pericles in the Corinthian gulf. The five
years' truce in 451 B.C. was only an armistice between
Athens and the Peloponnesian confederacy,
which left Bœotia to shake off the Athenian yoke by
its own exertions. This was also the time of the
Sacred war, in which a Spartan and an Athenian
army, one coming after the other, the first gave the
management of the temple to the Delphians, and the
second, against all ancient right,<a id="noteref_839" name="noteref_839" href="#note_839"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">839</span></span></a> to the Phocians.
At the end of these five years Megara revolted from
the Athenians, and in consequence an invasion of Attica
by the Peloponnesians took place, which, though
it did not produce any immediate result, was soon followed
by the thirty years' truce, in which Athens
ceded her conquests in Megaris and Peloponnesus,<a id="noteref_840" name="noteref_840" href="#note_840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">840</span></span></a>
and on the mainland returned within her ancient boundaries;
but she preserved the same power over her
other confederates. For when the Athenians soon
afterwards attacked the revolted island of Samos, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Peloponnesians indeed debated whether they should
protect it, but the proposal of Corinth was adopted,
that Athens should be allowed to deal with her allies
as she pleased.<a id="noteref_841" name="noteref_841" href="#note_841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. If now we consider the events which have been
briefly traced in the foregoing pages, it will be perceived,
that the principle on which the Lacedæmonians
constantly acted was one of self-defence, of restoring
what had been lost, or preserving what was threatened
with danger; whereas the Athenians were always
aiming at attack or conquest, or the change of existing
institutions. While the Spartans during this period,
even after the greatest victories, did not conquer a foot
of land, subjugate one independent state, or destroy
one existing institution; the Athenians, for a longer
or for a shorter time, reduced large tracts of country
under their dominion, extended their alliance (as it
was called) on all sides, and respected no connexion
sanctioned by nature, descent, or antiquity, when it
came in conflict with their plans of empire. But the
astonishing energy of the Athenian people, which from
one point kept the whole of Greece in constant vibration,
almost paralysed Sparta; the natural slowness of
that state became more and more apparent: which
having been, as it were, violently transplanted into a
strange region, only began by degrees to comprehend
the policy of Athens.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when Athens saw the Peloponnesian confederacy
again established, and as she could not, on account
of the truce, attack it directly, she looked to the colonial
law, which rested rather on hereditary feelings
than on positive institution, for an opportunity of an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indirect attack. This was soon found in the defensive
treaty with Corcyra, which state was engaged with its
mother country Corinth in a war, according to ancient
Greek principles, wholly unlawful and unjust. Besides
this, however, it was an actual breach of the
thirty years' truce.<a id="noteref_842" name="noteref_842" href="#note_842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a> And the same principles were
expressed in the demand that Potidæa should, for the
sake of the Athenian confederacy, give up its original
connexion with the parent state. In both these cases
it is manifest that the maxims of the Athenian policy
were directly at variance with the general feeling of
justice entertained by the Greeks, and especially with
the respect for affinity of blood; and this fundamental
difference was the true cause of the Peloponnesian war.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
13. As it would not be consistent with the plan of
this work to give a detailed account of the influence
of the Peloponnesian war upon the political and private
character of the Greeks, we must be content to
point out the following obvious points of opposition
between the contending parties. In the first place,
then, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dorians were opposed to Ionians</span></span>; and hence in
the well-known oracle it was called the Doric war.<a id="noteref_843" name="noteref_843" href="#note_843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">843</span></span></a>
The individual exceptions are for the most part merely
apparent;<a id="noteref_844" name="noteref_844" href="#note_844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a> also when the Athenians attacked Sicily,
all the Doric cities were opposed to them.<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href="#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a> On the
side of Athens were ranged all the Ionians of Europe,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the islands, and of Asia, not indeed voluntarily, but
still not altogether against their inclination. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
union of the free Greeks against the evil ambition
of one state.</span></span> At the beginning of the war the general
voice of Greece was in favour of Sparta<a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="#note_846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a>
(which was heard through the Delphian oracle, when it promised
that state assistance);<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> nor did she compel any
one to join in it. The allies of Athens, having previously
been Persian subjects, were accustomed to obey; and
on the present occasion forced to submit; the public
assembly of Athens was the only free voice in so large
a combination. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Land-forces against sea-forces.</span></span>
According to the speech of Pericles, Peloponnesus
was able, in an action with heavy-armed troops, to resist
all the rest of Greece together; and Athens
avoided coming to this mode of engagement with singular
ingenuity. The fleet of the Peloponnesians, on
the other hand, was at the beginning of the war very
inconsiderable.<a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href="#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a> Hence it was some time before the
belligerent parties even so much as encountered one
another. The land was the means of communication
for one party, the sea for the other: hence the states
friendly to Athens were immediately compelled to
build <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">long walls</span></em> for the purpose of connecting the
chief city with the sea, and isolating it from the land;
as Megara before, and Argos and Patræ during the
war.<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849" href="#note_849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Large bodies of men practised in war against
wealth.</span></span> The Peloponnesians carried on the war with
natives: whereas Athens manned her fleet—the basis
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of her power—chiefly with foreign seamen; so that
the Corinthians said justly that the power of Athens
was rather purchased than native.<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href="#note_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a> It was the main
principle of Pericles' policy, and it is also adopted by
Thucydides in the famous introduction to his History,
that it is not the country and people, but moveable
property, (χρήματα, in the proper sense of the word,)
which makes states great and powerful. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Slow and
deliberate conviction against determined rashness.</span></span>
This is evident both from the different direction taken
by the alliances of the two parties, and from their national
character. It was with good reason that the
oracle admonished Sparta to carry on the war with
decision and firmness; for that state was always cautious
of undertaking a war, and ready for peace.<a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href="#note_851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Maintenance of ancient custom as opposed to the desire
of novelty.</span></span> The former was the chief feature of
the Doric, the latter of the Ionic race. The Dorians
wished to preserve their ancient dignity and power, as
well as their customs and religious feelings: the
Ionians were commonly in pursuit of something new,
frequently, as in the case of the Sicilian expedition,
but obscurely seen and conceived. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Union of nations
and races against one arbitrarily formed.</span></span> As has
been already shown, this difference was the cause of
the war; and indeed Athens in the course of it hardly
recognised any duty in small states to remain faithful
to cities of the same race, and to their mother countries;
otherwise, why was Melos so barbarously
punished, for remembering rather that it was a colony
of Sparta than an island? Thus also in the interior
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of states the Athenians encouraged political associations
or clubs (ἑταιρίαι), while the Spartans trusted to
the ties of relationship.<a id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852" href="#note_852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristocracy
against democracy.</span></span><a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853" href="#note_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a>
This difference was manifested in the first
half of the war by Athens changing, while Sparta
only restored governments; for in this instance also
the power of Sparta was in strictness only employed
in upholding ancient establishments, as an aristocracy
may indeed be overthrown, but cannot be formed in a
moment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
14. These obvious points of difference are sufficient
to substantiate the result which we wish to arrive at.
It is manifest that the second of the two forces, which
in each of these instances came into collision, must
necessarily have always overcome the first. The slow,
cumbrous, unwieldy body of the Spartan confederacy
was sure to suffer under the blows of its skilful, forward,
and enterprising antagonist. The maxims
which, according to Thucydides, were current at this
time,<a id="noteref_854" name="noteref_854" href="#note_854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a> that rashness was to be called courage in a
friend's cause, provident foresight hidden cowardice,
moderation a cloak for pusillanimity, and that to be
prudent in every thing was to be active in nothing,
necessarily impeded and shackled the beneficial effects
of the measures of the Doric party. The <span class="tei tei-q">“honesty
and openness”</span> of the Doric character, the noble simplicity
of the ancient times of Greece, soon disappeared
in this tumultuous age.<a id="noteref_855" name="noteref_855" href="#note_855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a> Sparta therefore and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Peloponnesians emerge from the contest, altered,
and as it were reversed; and even before its termination
appear in a character of which they had before
probably contained only the first seeds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in the second half of the war, when the Spartans
gave up their great armaments by land, and
began to equip fleets with hired seamen; when they
had learnt to consider money as the chief instrument of
warfare, and begged it at the court of Persia; when
they sought less to protect the states joined to them by
affinity and alliance, than to dissolve the Athenian
confederacy; when they began to secure conquered
states by harmosts of their own, and by oligarchs forced
upon the people, and found that the secret management
of the political clubs was more to their interest
than open negotiation with the government; we see
developed on the one hand an energy and address,
which was first manifested in the enterprises of the
great Brasidas, and on the other a worldly policy, as
was shown in Gylippus, and afterwards more strongly
in Lysander; when the descendants of Hercules found
it advisable to exchange the lion's for the fox's skin.<a id="noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href="#note_856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a>
And, since the enterprises conducted in the spirit of
earlier times either wholly failed or else remained
fruitless, this new system, though the state had inwardly
declined, brought with it, by the mockery of
fate, external fame and victory.<a id="noteref_857" name="noteref_857" href="#note_857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">857</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. In turning from the history of the external affairs
of the Dorians to the consideration of their
intellectual existence, our first step must be to enquire
into their religion; and for this purpose we will proceed
to analyse and resolve it into the various worships
and ceremonies of which it was composed, and to trace
the origin and connexion of these as they successively
arose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now it may with safety be asserted, that the principal
deities of the Dorians were Apollo and Artemis,
since their worship is found to have predominated in
all the settlements of that race; and conversely the
Doric origin can be either proximately or remotely
traced wherever there were any considerable institutions
dedicated to the worship of Apollo; insomuch
that the adoration of this god may be shown from the
most ancient testimonies of mythology to have gradually
advanced with the extension of the Doric
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nation. Yet we are not to understand that the worship
of Apollo and the Doric race were so exactly co-extensive
that the presence of the latter always proves
either the previous or actual existence of the former.
Indeed it is certain that in ancient as well as in modern
times the worship of particular gods was not only
propagated by migration and conquest, but that religious
belief was also extended by peaceful intercourse,
and, as it were, by moral contact.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order to rest the claims of the Doric race to the
worship of Apollo on a secure foundation, it is necessary
first to give a direct contradiction to all those
statements which assert its connexion with any race
not of Hellenic descent. In the first place, then,
Apollo was not a national deity of the aboriginal
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pelasgic</span></em> nations of Greece.<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href="#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a> Had this been the case,
he would certainly have enjoyed frequent and distinguished
honours in those countries where the numbers
of that race remained undiminished; for example, in
Arcadia. Now there were very few temples of Apollo
in Arcadia; and moreover, the founding of most of
these was either connected with a foreign hero, or else
attributed to some external influence.<a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href="#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a> Secondly, it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has been supposed that the worship of this god was
introduced from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">East</span></em> (an opinion founded chiefly
on the establishments of his religion in Lycia); but we
shall presently show that its institution in this quarter
was in fact derived from the Dorians. To this we
may add, that amongst none of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">half-Grecian</span></em>
nations, for example, the Leleges, Carians, Ætolians,
Phrygians, and Thracians, the worship of this god can
be proved to have been national. The same may be
affirmed of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Italian</span></em> nations. Apollo never occurs
in the ancient <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Etruscan</span></em> religion. Nor was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></em>
acquainted with this worship, until it was introduced
by the Sibylline oracles; a sacred spot was then
allotted on the Flaminian meadow; and the temple
erected there (324 A.U.C.) was, up to the time of
Cicero, the only one in Rome.<a id="noteref_860" name="noteref_860" href="#note_860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a> Nay, that the Italians
adopted Apollo altogether as a foreign deity is proved
by the circumstance of their not having united him
with their native Jupiter, or Mercury, as they did the
Grecian Zeus, Hermes, &amp;c. In our inquiries therefore
into the origin of the worship of Apollo, we are
limited to the races of purely Greek offspring. It
remains only to be shown why we have selected the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dorians</span></em> in particular from all these different tribes.
And we merely make this preliminary remark, that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mythical genealogy, in which Dorus is called the son
of Apollo,<a id="noteref_861" name="noteref_861" href="#note_861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">861</span></span></a> was a simple expression for this
fact.

<a name="Book_II_Chapter_I_Section_2" id="Book_II_Chapter_I_Section_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. The most ancient settlements of the Doric race,
of which any historical accounts are extant, were, as
we before ascertained,<a id="noteref_862" name="noteref_862" href="#note_862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">862</span></span></a> the country at the foot of
Olympus and Ossa, near the valley of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Tempe</span></span>. In
this district there were two sanctuaries, bearing the
character of the highest antiquity, viz., the Pythium,
on the ridge of Olympus, near a steep mountain-pass
leading to Macedonia; and the altar in the ravine of
the Peneus,<a id="noteref_863" name="noteref_863" href="#note_863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a> from which the god himself was called
Τεμπείτας; and in an inscription discovered near this
spot, on the banks of the river between Tempe and
Larissa, are the words ΑΠΛΟΥΝΙ ΤΕΜΠΕΙΤΑ,
<span class="tei tei-q">“To Apollo of Tempe.”</span><a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> From another inscription
found in this district we gather an account of certain
native Thessalian festivals, at which branches of laurel
were carried round, that were doubtless procured from
the groves in the valley of Tempe; whither also the
Delphians every eight years, at the expiration of the
sacred period, sent the Pythian theori, who, after the
performance of a sacrifice, broke the expiatory branch
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the sacred laurel-tree.<a id="noteref_865" name="noteref_865" href="#note_865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a> According also to the
admission of the Delphians themselves, the temple of
Apollo at Tempe was more ancient than their own,
since a perfect expiation could only be performed in
that sanctuary. In accordance with the tradition that
Apollo himself, after having slain the Python, fled to
the altar at Tempe to be purified from the pollution,
the sacred boy, at each return of the appointed day,
went to Tempe by a certain path,<a id="noteref_866" name="noteref_866" href="#note_866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a> in imitation of the
god whom he honoured, in order to return home
amidst the joyful songs of the choruses of virgins, as
δαφνηφόρος, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">laurel-bearer</span></span>. The religious usages
at this festival will be investigated hereafter; here we
will only consider the route which the procession took.
It led through Thessaly and Pelasgia (that is, through
the plain of the Peneus, which stretches to the south
as far as Pheræ); then through the country of the
Malians and Ænianes, over mount Œta, through
Doris and the western part of Locris;<a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href="#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a> avoiding in a
remarkable manner the shorter and more frequented
road from Thessaly through Thermopylæ, over Phocis,
and through the pass of Panopeus and Daulis to
Delphi. The reasons of this deviation may have been
the opposition offered in early times by hostile tribes
from the eastern side of Delphi to the peaceable march
of sacred processions; and also that the theoria might
in its progress pass through the second settlements of
the Dorians, between Œta and Parnassus, where
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
doubtless the worship of Apollo had likewise
prevailed.<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href="#note_868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">868</span></span></a>

3. The first half of the Pythian road, which goes
through Thessaly, is very accurately determined by a
combination of different testimonies. Its first stage
was from Tempe to Larissa. Near this place was a
village named Deipnias, where the boy who carried
the laurel-branch first broke his long fast;<a id="noteref_869" name="noteref_869" href="#note_869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">869</span></span></a> as Apollo
himself was reported also to have done. That the
place received its name from this circumstance is a
sufficient proof of the antiquity of the usage. The
theoria next proceeded to Pheræ, where the boy, on
his way to Tempe, and before his purification, represented
the servitude of Apollo when a refugee at the
palace of Admetus. This use of slavery as a preparative
for the expiation of guilt, is doubtless taken
from some very ancient tradition; and it is alluded to
by the earliest epic poets; in the Iliad the horses of
Eumelus, the son of Admetus, are stated to have
derived their excellence from having been under the
care of Apollo at Pheræ.<a id="noteref_870" name="noteref_870" href="#note_870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">870</span></span></a> The harbour of Pheræ was
Pagasæ, in the furthest recess of the Pagasæan bay,
in which place there was a celebrated altar of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pagasæan Apollo, situated in an extensive grove,<a id="noteref_871" name="noteref_871" href="#note_871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">871</span></span></a>
where there were large numbers of sacred ravens.<a id="noteref_872" name="noteref_872" href="#note_872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">872</span></span></a>
This sanctuary is the theatre of Hesiod's poem of the
Shield of Hercules; and at no great distance the river
Anaurus runs into the sea,<a id="noteref_873" name="noteref_873" href="#note_873"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">873</span></span></a> which stream, swollen by
violent storms of rain carried away the tomb of Cycnus,
the son of Mars; <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for thus Apollo, the son of
Latona, willed it, because Cycnus had plundered
the hecatombs which the nations brought to the
temple of Pytho.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_874" name="noteref_874" href="#note_874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">874</span></span></a> Hence it is evident
that the Pagasæan sanctuary was situated on the road consecrated
by the processions to and from Delphi; and we
may perceive also in these words of Hesiod an allusion
to a fable perhaps much celebrated by early poets,
viz., that Cycnus was slain for having profaned the
temple of Apollo.<a id="noteref_875" name="noteref_875" href="#note_875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">875</span></span></a> Moreover, the legend related by
Heraclides Ponticus, that Trophonius founded the
temple of Apollo at Pagasæ,<a id="noteref_876" name="noteref_876" href="#note_876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">876</span></span></a> points to the connexion
with Delphi; the same Trophonius, a renowned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
architect of the mythical age, is also said to have built
the most ancient temple of Pytho.

4. We thus arrive at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Delphi</span></span>, the second grand
station of the worship of Apollo, and, as it were, a
focus, from which it diverged in numberless directions,
and to which it was again partially reflected. Now
although from early times the singular and striking
character of the place might often have raised the feelings
to ecstasy, and excited in the spectator dim and
shadowy forebodings of the future; yet the establishment
of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fixed</span></em> institution, with its sacred regulations
and rights, was intimately connected with the introduction
of the worship of Apollo. At what time,
however, did this first obtain a footing at Delphi?
Probably when the Doric race came from Hestiæotis
to Parnassus, and settled above Delphi, which event
took place at a very early period. This supposition,
to which we are led by the preceding inquiry, is not
inconsistent with the celebrated tradition that Cretan
navigators landed on this coast in the time of Minos,
and there introduced the worship of Apollo. In order,
however, to reconcile these two accounts, we must first
examine the Cretan worship of that god.

5. The population of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Crete</span></span> having been in early
times composed of a heterogeneous mixture of different
nations, it was natural that the worships of many different
gods should prevail there; yet in many cases it
is possible to ascertain the nation from which they
severally originated. Amongst these, the Dorians,
whose chief settlement was on the north-eastern coast
near Cnosus (from which point, however, they very
soon spread over other parts of the island), had brought
over the worship of Apollo from their settlements
under Olympus. According to a tradition preserved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the Homeric hymn to Apollo, the ship, which
Apollo in the shape of a dolphin conducted to Delphi,
set out from the city of Cnosus. Of this city the chief
temple was that of Apollo Delphinius.<a id="noteref_877" name="noteref_877" href="#note_877"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">877</span></span></a> In its territory
was situated a place called Apollonia; and the
remarkable town of Amnisus, with the grotto of Eileithyia,
where it was supposed that this goddess, who
assisted at the birth of Apollo, was herself born.<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878" href="#note_878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a> On
the same coast are Miletus, where (as will be mentioned
hereafter) the worship of Apollo prevailed, and
Lato (Camira), whose name reminds us of the goddess
Latona. It cannot be doubted that the same worship
also prevailed in the ancient Doric town of Lyctus, in
the interior of the island.<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879" href="#note_879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a> Nearer to the southern coast
was Gortyna, which, though founded by a different
race, yet in later times recognised the dominion and
worship of the same nation as Cnosus: accordingly, the most central point of this city
was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pythium</span></span>.<a id="noteref_880" name="noteref_880" href="#note_880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">880</span></span></a>
Immediately bordering on it was Phæstus, the birthplace
of Epimenides, which town was said to have
derived its origin and name from a Heraclid of Sicyon.<a id="noteref_881" name="noteref_881" href="#note_881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">881</span></span></a>
Here, together with Hercules, Apollo and Latona received
particular honours.<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882" href="#note_882"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">882</span></span></a> Further on towards the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
west, in the mountains, was Tarrha, one of the most
ancient and considerable temples of Apollo.<a id="noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href="#note_883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a> Here,
according to the Cretan tradition, dwelt Carmanor the
father of the minstrel Chrysothemis, a priest who was
said to have purified Apollo himself from the blood of
the Python;<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href="#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a> which legend, when compared with the
account of his expiation at the altar in the valley of
Tempe, shows how the legends connected with the
worship of Apollo crossed over to Crete, and there
again took root. With the residence of Apollo when
a refugee in the house of Carmanor, there is connected
a tradition of his amour with Acacallis, who bore him
Naxos,<a id="noteref_885" name="noteref_885" href="#note_885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a> or Miletus,<a id="noteref_886" name="noteref_886" href="#note_886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a> or Phylander and Phylacis, who,
in a sacred offering of the Elyrians at Delphi, were
represented as sucking the teat of a she-goat.<a id="noteref_887" name="noteref_887" href="#note_887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">887</span></span></a> This
Elyrus, like most of the ancient towns of Crete, was
situated in the mountains of the interior, probably not
far from Tarrha.<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href="#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a> Although there have not been preserved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accounts sufficient to lead to any general conclusion,
yet those which we have adduced establish the
position that it was not the original inhabitants of
mount Ida or any supposed colonists from Phœnicia,
but the Dorian invaders alone who made Crete the
head-quarters of the worship of Apollo: we therefore
assert that this worship (as originally founded in Crete),
had not the slightest connexion with the enthusiastic
(and probably Phrygian) orgies of the Idæan Zeus,
with the Corybantes, &amp;c. Yet from these ceremonies
being celebrated at so short a distance from each other,
confusions soon arose; so that in later times the
Curetes were called the sons of Apollo.<a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889" href="#note_889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a> According
to some writers, Corybas was the father of Apollo, and
he was reported to have disputed the sovereignty of
Crete with Zeus.<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href="#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. From Crete, we will now proceed to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Delos</span></span>.
Virgil, on the authority (as it appears) of some ancient
epic poet, calls the Cretans ministers of the Delian
altars.<a id="noteref_891" name="noteref_891" href="#note_891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a> The voyages of Theseus from Cnosus to Delos
is also founded on the same connexion, as will be
more fully explained
hereafter.<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href="#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a> We must not, however,
too hastily conclude, that in the age of Minos,
when the Cretans were the dominant nation in the
Greek Archipelago, Delos received the worship of
Apollo from a Cretan colony.<a id="noteref_893" name="noteref_893" href="#note_893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a> It may with greater
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
probability be conjectured, that the Dorians in their
first expedition to Crete (which could hardly have
traversed so great a distance without leaving behind
some traces of its existence) had founded the sanctuary
at Delos; since the tradition of the transmission of
sacred presents from the country of the Hyperboreans
to that island, is most simply explained as a memorial
of a religious connexion, which had once been long
maintained, by means of sacred processions, with the
northern settlements of the Dorians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Now respecting the presence of Cretans at
Delphi, it was nothing more than an attempt of these
islanders, who dwelt on the very verge of the Grecian
territory, to gain for themselves the credit of a reciprocal
influence upon the early settlements of their
own race and religion. We find in the Hymn of
Homer, that Apollo, descending from Olympus, himself
founded his temple at Pytho, and afterwards
obtained experienced priests, minstrels, and prophets<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href="#note_894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a>
from Cnosus; for which purpose he, in the shape
of a dolphin, conducted a Cretan vessel to Crissa.
Crissa, or Cirrha (for that the same place was originally
signified by both names I consider as certain<a id="noteref_895" name="noteref_895" href="#note_895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">895</span></span></a>),
a fortified town in the inmost recess of the Crissæan
bay, was probably a settlement of this Cretan colony,
as the name Κρῖσα seems to signify nothing else than
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cretan</span></em> city (Κρησία πόλις).<a id="noteref_896" name="noteref_896" href="#note_896"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">896</span></span></a> Although the Pythian
sanctuary itself was situated in the territory of Crissa,<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897" href="#note_897"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">897</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yet the town of Crissa possessed, besides an altar
of Apollo Delphinius on the shore, in early times one
of the chief temples of Apollo:<a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href="#note_898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a> hence in Homer's
Catalogue the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacred</span></em> Crissa is mentioned, together
with the rocky Pytho; and the Pythian sanctuary
is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Crissæa templa</span></span>, on the faith of some ancient
tradition, by a Roman poet. This expression must
have been borrowed from poems anterior to the destruction
of Cirrha (about 585 B.C.) before this town
had by its extortions and oppression of pilgrims deserved
the wrath of the Amphictyonic confederacy;
nor is it probable that it retained a share in the
management of the Delphian temple up to the very
last moment of its political existence, when it was
visited with a destruction so complete, as nearly to
deprive us of all knowledge of its previous history.
The unfortified town of Delphi, which, with the Amphictyons,
obtained after that war the sole management
of the temple, previously perhaps had not been a
place of any importance; at least it is not mentioned
in any earlier writings than one of the most recent
hymns of Homer, and by Heraclitus of Ephesus.<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href="#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a>

8. In ancient times the service of the temple,
as appears from the Homeric Hymn, was performed
both at Delos and Delphi by Cretans; but it is
scarcely possible that they should have constituted
the whole population of the country. For, in the
first place, the extensive territory of the temple was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cultivated by a subject people, of whom we shall
speak hereafter, and who were certainly not of Doric,
and probably in few cases of Cretan descent;<a id="noteref_900" name="noteref_900" href="#note_900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">900</span></span></a> besides
whom there was a native nobility, whose influence
over the temple was very considerable. These are
the persons who, according to Euripides, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sat near
the tripod, the Delphian nobles, chosen by lot</span></span>;”</span><a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href="#note_901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a>
called also <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the lords and princes of the Delphians</span></span>.”</span>
They also formed a criminal court, which, by the
Pythian vote, sentenced all offenders against the
temple to be hurled from a precipice.<a id="noteref_902" name="noteref_902" href="#note_902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">902</span></span></a> To the same
persons also doubtless belonged the permission and
superintendence of the ancient rite of expiation; and
it was their duty (as it was that of the court of the
Samothracian priests) to determine whether a homicide
was expiable or not. Their influence over the oracle
was so great, that they may be considered to have
been the actual managers of it. Their political bias
may be inferred from the fact, that Timasitheus the
Delphian distinguished himself by his boldness and
resolution among the aristocratical party of Isagoras
at Athens.<a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903" href="#note_903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a> It appears that these families originally
came to Delphi from the mountainous country in
the interior. Thus the chief-priests of the god, the
five Ὅσιοι, were chosen by lot from a number of
families who derived their descent from Deucalion,<a id="noteref_904" name="noteref_904" href="#note_904"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">904</span></span></a> by

was in all probability of Doric origin, since it
formed the communication between the Tetrapolis and
Delphi.<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href="#note_908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a> The language spoken at Delphi was likewise

If then this was the case, Doric mountaineers from
the heights of Parnassus, and Cretan colonists on the
sea-coast, met together (according to a very uncertain
computation about 200 years before the Doric
migration into Peloponnesus), in order to establish
the Delphian worship. The Doric dialect, it may
be observed, which prevailed at Delphi, was common
to both parties. It is known from many traditions

of rude carving, were also reported to have been
brought from Crete. The fabulous series of Delphic
minstrels began with Chrysothemis, the son of Carmanor,
the above-mentioned priest of Tarrha.<a id="noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href="#note_911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a> Crete,
however, did not merely send works of sculpture and
hymns to Delphi, but sometimes even men,<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912" href="#note_912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a> for the
service of the Pythian Apollo.

9. I know not whether these accounts are sufficient
to afford an intelligible description of a time when
the worship of Apollo, being established at the foot
of Olympus, Parnassus, and in the distant island
of Crete, and producing a certain degree of communication
between these points, had not as yet penetrated
to any part of Greece which lay to the south
of Œta and Parnassus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is evident, moreover, that the extension of this
worship met with a long opposition. Apollo is in
ancient traditions represented as himself protecting
his own temple.<a id="noteref_913" name="noteref_913" href="#note_913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a> The Phlegyans to the
east, and the Ætolians to the west, appear to have been particularly
adverse to the worship of the Delphian Apollo. That
there was a national opposition caused by the Phlegyans
possessing the stronghold of Panopeus in the
mountain-passes towards Bœotia, is shown by the
legends, that Phorbas their leader wrestled there with
Apollo; that Phlegyas burned the temple to the
ground; and lastly, that Apollo exterminated their
whole race with thunder and lightning.<a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href="#note_914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a> The same

great deity of the Dorians, which, under the name
of Lapithæ, opposed the Dorians themselves in Thessaly.
And on the other side, Apollo was related
in the Poems of Hesiod, and the Minyad, to have
assisted the Locrian Curetes against the Ætolians,
and slain their prince Meleager.<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href="#note_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a>

1. But whilst the worship of Apollo was experiencing
so much opposition in the north of Greece,
the sea, with the neighbouring coasts and islands
afforded ample opportunities for its propagation from
the shores of Crete. This serves to account for the
singular fact, that the most ancient temples of Apollo
throughout the south of Greece, are found in maritime
districts, and generally on promontories and headlands.

however probably not founded on tradition, the popular
idea being that he was a brother of Minos the Cnosian,
whom it represented as a prince of purely Hellenic
blood. By these means the Cretan laws (that is, the
Doric customs, which had been first fully developed
in Crete), and also the Doric worship of Apollo,
were spread over Lycia. For the situation of the
chief temples is a sufficient proof that the settlers
of Lycia came, not from the inland countries of Asia,
but over the sea to the coast. Xanthus, a city renowned
for the valour of its inhabitants,<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a> and situated

These are the only remains of the national tradition,
which in its general character was perhaps only another
version of that prevalent at Delos. But the chief
temple was one at Patara, in the southern extremity of

Amongst these settlements we must probably also
reckon that on the promontory of Corycus in Cilicia,
since we find in its vicinity the temple of Zeus Sarpedon.
The name of the place, if compared with that

evidence that the worship of Apollo prevailed
there, which is still further proved by the tradition that

northern foot of mount Ida, and the native place of the
archer Pandarus, the son of Lycaon, worshipped
Apollo under the title of Lycius, or Lycegenes; and
that Zelea was also called Lycia;<a id="noteref_942" name="noteref_942" href="#note_942"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a> for these facts show
that there was a real connexion between the name of
Lycia and the worship of Apollo, and that it was the
worship of Apollo which gave the name to this district
of Troy, as it had done to the country of the Solymi.
In Chryse also Apollo was called Lycæus.<a id="noteref_943" name="noteref_943" href="#note_943"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">943</span></span></a> The
origin of this worship can neither be attributed to the
native Trojan and Dardan race, nor yet to the later
Æolians, although these for the most part adopted it
into their religious ceremonies.<a id="noteref_944" name="noteref_944" href="#note_944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a> It is however certain,
from an ancient tradition, that the Cretans also
colonized this coast; though we are not aware what
was the precise account of Callinus, the ancient elegiac
poet,<a id="noteref_945" name="noteref_945" href="#note_945"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">945</span></span></a> who preserved it. It was however the popular
belief that Apollo Smintheus, and indeed the whole
Trojan nation, were derived from Crete.<a id="noteref_946" name="noteref_946" href="#note_946"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">946</span></span></a> The last
notion, that all the Trojans were of Cretan origin, is
in the highest degree improbable; but it will hardly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be denied that there came to Troy a Cretan colony in
connexion with Apollo Smintheus. Indeed the Cretans
who inhabited the district of Troy must often
have been mentioned in ancient traditions, as a strange
account of their strict administration of justice has
been preserved.<a id="noteref_947" name="noteref_947" href="#note_947"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">947</span></span></a> Could we but obtain a more authentic
source of traditions relating to the religious
worship than the deceitful accounts of poets, we might
perhaps discover in it many confirmations of the historical
traces to which we have just adverted. Even
now we may perceive that the servitude of Apollo
under Laomedon<a id="noteref_948" name="noteref_948" href="#note_948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">948</span></span></a> is the same fable as that of Admetus
at Pheræ, the locality alone being changed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. By observing Homer's accounts of the worship
of Apollo in different Trojan families, we may discover
a remarkable consistency and connexion in the
ancient tradition.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place he represents it as belonging
chiefly to the family of the Panthoidæ. Panthus
(from whom a tribe in modern Ilium derived its name

was in the heroic mythology represented as odious to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other family, described in the Iliad as connected
with Apollo, is that of Æneas, whom, when
wounded by Diomed, the god himself conducted to his
temple on the citadel of Troy, and delivered over to
the care of Latona and Artemis.<a id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href="#note_953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> Now that this
history was not a mere arbitrary fiction of the poet
may be distinctly proved. For we know that, after
Troy had fallen, the remaining Trojans still maintained
themselves in the mountains; they are mentioned
by Herodotus as a separate state existing in the
stronghold of Gergis, in the defiles of Ida;<a id="noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href="#note_954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a> and, even
after the Peloponnesian war, Dardan princes reigned
here and at Scepsis.<a id="noteref_955" name="noteref_955" href="#note_955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">955</span></span></a> It can, we think,
be shown that Homer's prophecy<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href="#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a> respecting the future dominion of
the descendants of Æneas over the remnant of the
Trojan nation, refers solely to the town of Gergis, and
perhaps to the neighbouring valleys. Now the chief
temple at Gergis was that of Apollo,<a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href="#note_957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">957</span></span></a> and in the same
town there was an ancient Sibylline oracle, known by
the name of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hellespontine</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mermessian</span></span>.
We now see that the ancient poet, being well acquainted
with the existence of the Æneadæ at Gergis, their
festivals and sacrifices, felt himself bound, according
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the spirit of mythology, to represent Apollo as the
ancient guardian of that family.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall seize this opportunity of briefly pointing
out the results which may be drawn from these
facts, in illustration of the fable of Æneas. We must
first assume that the above oracle of Apollo at Gergis
announced to the Trojan Gergithians the re-establishment
of their nation under the dominion of the descendants
of Æneas. Such a prophecy, in fact, agrees so
exactly with the spirit and system of the ancient oracles,
that its existence can scarcely be doubted. The
hopes, the longing after a restoration of their ancient
power, must necessarily have assumed this form among
the distressed and conquered Trojans. Now a colony
of Gergithians also inhabited the territory of the
Æolian Cume,<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href="#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a> where Apollo possessed a magnificent
temple;<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href="#note_959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a> and if these oracles had been known
to the Cumæans, they would readily have passed over to their
kinsmen the Cumans of Campania. At this last place
there was, on the summit of a rock, a temple of Apollo
(one of the most ancient in the whole settlement, and,
as it was pretended, built by Dædalus);<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href="#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a> underneath
was the grotto of the sibyl. Here it was said that
Æneas landed; and here, according to Stesichorus,
he remained, and never went further to the north.<a id="noteref_961" name="noteref_961" href="#note_961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a>
Nothing was more probable than that these oracles
should in both cases have been applied locally, and
that a new Troy should in consequence have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
founded both in Asia and Italy. Hence, when the
Greek sibylline oracles, in connexion with the worship
of Apollo, became the state-oracles of Rome, all that
had been prophesied of districts near the Hellespont
was, without scruple or ceremony (though not without
the ingenuity of commentators and interpreters), applied
to Rome. It is evident that the origin of the
strange fable of Æneas, the father of Romulus, and all
that was afterwards added to it, may be explained in
this simple manner.

 5. The most ancient temple of Apollo in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Thrace</span></span>

or Maroneia;<a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a> Maron its priest being, according
to tradition, a Cretan adventurer.<a id="noteref_963" name="noteref_963" href="#note_963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">963</span></span></a> With this
sanctuary was probably connected the ancient oracular
temple of Apollo at Deræa near Abdera,<a id="noteref_964" name="noteref_964" href="#note_964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a> alluded to
in the device on the coins of Abdera; on one side of
which Apollo is seen with the arrow in his hand; and
on the reverse is a griffin, a symbol which appears to
have been adopted by the Teians in consequence of
their having resided for some time in their colony of
Abdera.

<a name="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_6" id="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_6" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
6. The Cretan worshippers of Apollo also established
some considerable temples on the Ionian coast.
The principal of these was the Didymæum, in the
territory of Miletus. Before the Ionic migration,
Miletus was a Cretan fortress, on the coast, in a country
at that time called Caria.<a id="noteref_965" name="noteref_965" href="#note_965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">965</span></span></a> The disagreement of traditions
as to whether Sarpedon or Miletus (the Cretan)
was the founder, confirms, rather than weakens, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
principal fact of its settlement from Crete, both traditions
describing the same fact in a different manner.
With the founding of this stronghold was connected
that of a temple, which is ascribed to Branchus, an
expiatory priest<a id="noteref_966" name="noteref_966" href="#note_966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">966</span></span></a> of Delphi, whose name (which was
well fitted for a prophet),<a id="noteref_967" name="noteref_967" href="#note_967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">967</span></span></a> moulded into a patronymic
form, was afterwards adopted by the priests of the
temple;<a id="noteref_968" name="noteref_968" href="#note_968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">968</span></span></a> the temple itself, and even the place (which
was also called Didyma). Thus we here again see a
fresh connexion between the Delphians and Cretans,
there being indeed hardly any distinction between them
before they were dispersed by the different migrations
of the Doric race. The worship at Didyma was in
fact the same with that of Crete and Delphi; expiatory
ceremonies and prophecies being united, and the latter
delivered with rites very similar to those observed at
the Pythian oracle. Apollo was here called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philesius</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Delphinius</span></span>, which names were afterwards adopted
by other Ionians;<a id="noteref_969" name="noteref_969" href="#note_969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">969</span></span></a> with him was connected Zeus, both,
according to Callimachus, being the ancestors of
Didyma; and also Artemis, who, in an ancient hymn
ascribed to Branchus, is with Apollo addressed under
the titles of ἑκάεργος and ἑκαέργη.<a id="noteref_970" name="noteref_970" href="#note_970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">970</span></span></a> The
ruins of this temple, so highly honoured in Asia, still bear witness
to its ancient fame and splendour. From the temple
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the harbour<a id="noteref_971" name="noteref_971" href="#note_971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">971</span></span></a> Panormus there was a sacred road
adorned on both sides with more than sixty statues in

an Egyptian lion attests the connexion of king Necho
with the oracle.<a id="noteref_972" name="noteref_972" href="#note_972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">972</span></span></a> The Ionians of Miletus, however,
acknowledged the god of Branchidæ as the principal
deity in their town, and introduced him into their
numerous colonies, from Naucratis<a id="noteref_973" name="noteref_973" href="#note_973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">973</span></span></a> to Cyzicus,<a id="noteref_974" name="noteref_974" href="#note_974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">974</span></span></a> Parium,<a id="noteref_975" name="noteref_975" href="#note_975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">975</span></span></a>

7. The twin brother of the Didymæan god, both
in origin and in the similarity of worship, is the
Clarian Apollo. However fabulous the particular
circumstances of its foundation, still it was impossible
in ancient times to invent a religious colonial connexion
where none in fact existed. The traditions
manifestly imply a double dependence of the establishment
at Claros: viz., upon Delphi and Crete.
Manto, the daughter of Teiresias the Theban soothsayer,
was, according to the epic poets, consecrated
by the Epigoni to the Delphian Apollo after the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
taking of Thebes,<a id="noteref_978" name="noteref_978" href="#note_978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">978</span></span></a> and she was afterwards sent by
Apollo to the spot on which the Ionians at a later
period founded the city of Colophon; having, in
obedience to the commands of the oracle, married on
her way Rhacius the Cretan, whose name, according
to the dialect of Crete, had the double form Rhacius
and Lacius.<a id="noteref_979" name="noteref_979" href="#note_979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">979</span></span></a> Augias, the Cyclic poet, mentioned the
tomb of her father Teiresias at Colophon,<a id="noteref_980" name="noteref_980" href="#note_980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">980</span></span></a>
which was generally supposed to be in Bœotia. The offspring
of this marriage was Mopsus, who was probably
called the progenitor of the family from which, even
in the Roman time, the priests of the oracle were
selected.<a id="noteref_981" name="noteref_981" href="#note_981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">981</span></span></a> The forms of prophecy were in this temple
also similar to those at Delphi.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other temples of Apollo on the coast of Asia
Minor were generally connected with some one of
the four already mentioned. The temple of Leucæ,
between Smyrna and Phocæa (where the Cumæans
celebrated a festival),<a id="noteref_982" name="noteref_982" href="#note_982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">982</span></span></a> was probably
a member of the Trojan family, to which the Grynean Apollo, in
the territory of Myrina near Cume (where there
was also an oracle), appears to be related.<a id="noteref_983" name="noteref_983" href="#note_983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">983</span></span></a> Apollo
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Malloeis, in the territory of Mytilene, in Lesbos, was
an off-shoot of the Clarian worship:<a id="noteref_984" name="noteref_984" href="#note_984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">984</span></span></a> to the same
branch also belonged the oracle of Apollo at Mallus
in Cilicia,<a id="noteref_985" name="noteref_985" href="#note_985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">985</span></span></a> inasmuch as it was said to have been
founded by Mopsus the son of Manto.

<a name="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_8" id="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_8" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
8. The worship of Apollo also penetrated to several
parts of European Greece, where it was established
by Cretan adventurers on capes and headlands—particularly
at Trœzen, Tænarum, Megara, and Thoricus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Trœzen</span></span>, as has been above
remarked,<a id="noteref_986" name="noteref_986" href="#note_986"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">986</span></span></a> shared
with Athens both the race of her inhabitants and
her worship, together with the connexion between
Athens and Crete; the meaning of which will be
explained hereafter.<a id="noteref_987" name="noteref_987" href="#note_987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">987</span></span></a> Hence we may conjecture the
Cretan origin of the nine families, which were in
existence at a late date at Trœzen, and in early
times performed the rites of atonement and purification
(of which Orestes was said to have been the first
subject) near a laurel-tree in front of the temple
of Apollo, and a sacred stone in front of the temple
of the Lycean Artemis.<a id="noteref_988" name="noteref_988" href="#note_988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">988</span></span></a>

The expiatory establishment<a id="noteref_989" name="noteref_989" href="#note_989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">989</span></span></a> on the
promontory of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Tænarum</span></span> was also said to have been founded by
Tettix, a Cretan,<a id="noteref_990" name="noteref_990" href="#note_990"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">990</span></span></a> who is merely a personified symbol
of Apollo, like Lycus, Corax, Cycnus, &amp;c, in other
places. Callondas is said to have purified the soul
of the murdered Archilochus at this gate of the infernal
regions. Considering the proximity of Delium
in Laconia<a id="noteref_991" name="noteref_991" href="#note_991"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">991</span></span></a> and of the little island of Minoa to this
temple, we may conclude that the origin of the above
sanctuary was connected with these places.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In front of the harbour of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Megara</span></span> was another
island called Minoa, and numerous legends had been
there preserved in which the Cretans of Minoa (though
probably only by a corruption of the original tradition)
were represented as enemies and plunderers.
Megara had two citadels: the Carian with the temple
of Demeter, and a more modern one towards the sea,
surmounted by temples of Apollo. This is said to
have been built by Alcathous the son of Pelops, while
Apollo stood by and played upon his lyre. A
sounding-block of stone was exhibited at the place
where the god lay down his lyre.<a id="noteref_992" name="noteref_992" href="#note_992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">992</span></span></a> The same fable is
also alluded to by Theognis of Megara.<a id="noteref_993" name="noteref_993" href="#note_993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">993</span></span></a> Here then
there is a worship and temples of an earlier date
than the Doric migration, and which certainly proceeded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from Crete. On the former citadel stood a
statue of Apollo Decatephorus,<a id="noteref_994" name="noteref_994" href="#note_994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">994</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“the receiver of
tithes,”</span> whose name is explained by the fable that
the daughter of Alcathous was once sent as a tribute
to Crete, like the Athenian youths and maidens.
Thus a fact which will be soon proved with respect
to Athens, is also true of Megara—viz., that these
missions always conveyed a sacred tithe.<a id="noteref_995" name="noteref_995" href="#note_995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">995</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. The process of our investigation will shortly
lead us to examine the Attic legends, consisting of
a confused mass of tradition, with which the worship
of all the gods, including that of Apollo, was in that
country perplexed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To commence then with the legends which are
connected with the temple of Apollo at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Thoricus</span></span>.
Thoricus, situated on the south-eastern coast of Attica,
was one of the ancient twelve towns of that country,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and always remained a place of consequence, of which
there are still extant considerable remains. Favoured
by its situation, it soon became a commercial station;
Cretan vessels were accustomed in ancient times to
anchor in its harbour.<a id="noteref_996" name="noteref_996" href="#note_996"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">996</span></span></a> The fable of
Cephalus and Procris appears, from some poetical and mythological
accounts, to have been connected with Crete and the
worship of Apollo.<a id="noteref_997" name="noteref_997" href="#note_997"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">997</span></span></a> We know for certain that the
Cephalidæ, who existed at a still later period in
Attica,<a id="noteref_998" name="noteref_998" href="#note_998"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">998</span></span></a> preserved some hereditary rites of Apollo:
for when in the tenth generation Chalcinus and Dætus,
the descendants of the hero, returned to the country
which their ancestor had quitted in consequence of
murder, they immediately built a temple to that god
on the road to Eleusis.<a id="noteref_999" name="noteref_999" href="#note_999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">999</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_10" id="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
10. But the fable of Cephalus was also connected
with another great temple of Apollo, which in the
west of Greece looked down from the chalky cliffs
of the promontory of Leucatas over the Ionian sea,
and of which there are ruins still extant.<a id="noteref_1000" name="noteref_1000" href="#note_1000"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1000</span></span></a> Now
Cephalus, the hero of Thoricus, is said to have gained
these regions in company with Amphitryon:<a id="noteref_1001" name="noteref_1001" href="#note_1001"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1001</span></span></a>
he is also said to have first made the celebrated leap
from the rock of Leucatas.<a id="noteref_1002" name="noteref_1002" href="#note_1002"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1002</span></span></a> This leap, doubtless,
had originally a religious meaning, and was an expiatory
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rite. At the Athenian festival of Thargelia, a
festival sacred to Apollo, criminals, crowned as victims,
were led to the edge of a rock, and thrown down
to the bottom; and the same ceremony appears to have been performed
on certain sacred occasions at Leucatas.<a id="noteref_1003" name="noteref_1003" href="#note_1003"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1003</span></span></a>
Here, however, the fall of the criminal was
broken by tying feathers, and even birds, to his body;
below, he was taken up, and conveyed to a distance,
that he might carry away with him every particle
of guilt. This was without doubt the original meaning
of the leap of Cephalus, who was stained with
the guilt of homicide, and on that very account a
fugitive from his country. According to a legend
noticed in an ancient epic poem, his purification took
place at Thebes;<a id="noteref_1004" name="noteref_1004" href="#note_1004"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1004</span></span></a> whereas the Leucadian tradition
doubtless represented his leap from the rock as the act
of atonement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In later times, indeed, the object of this leap was
totally altered; it was supposed to be a specific for
disappointed love.<a id="noteref_1005" name="noteref_1005" href="#note_1005"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1005</span></span></a> This singular application of the
ancient custom gave a romantic colour to the legend
connected with it. Cephalus and Procris were also
represented in after-times as tormented by love and
jealousy. Probably the story partly obtained this
form in Cyprus, the island of Aphrodite, whither the
fable of Cephalus<a id="noteref_1006" name="noteref_1006" href="#note_1006"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1006</span></span></a> was early carried by Attic settlers.
But in whatever manner it was perverted,
we cannot doubt that the leap of Cephalus from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Leucadian rock was a part of the expiatory worship
of Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These considerations refer to the Cretan rites solemnized
at Thoricus. In Athens itself, the traditions
of Crete and Delphi being found united together, it is
necessary that we should first return to the latter
place, and follow the Pythian worship through
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Bœotia</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_11" id="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_11" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
11. This indeed is neither the time nor place to
relate how the Pythian worship, in spite of the opposition
of hostile races, traced the route of the procession
through the passes of Parnassus. The fact
is indeed evident from an almost unbroken chain
of temples and oracles, the links of which, viz.,
Thurium, Tilphossium, the temple of Galaxius, the
oracle of Eutresis, the Ismenium, Tenerium, Ptoum,
and Tegyra, are all connected either by tradition or
religious rites with Delphi. Delium is probably the
only place on the eastern coast founded from Delos.
Pindar represents the establishment of several such
temples under the form of a migration of the god
himself.<a id="noteref_1007" name="noteref_1007" href="#note_1007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1007</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall content myself with noticing a few of the
temples above-mentioned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first in order is the oracle at the fountain
of Tilphossa under Mount Helicon, famous for the
grave of Tiresias and the monument of Rhadamanthus,
who is said to have dwelt here with Alcmena
the mother of Hercules.<a id="noteref_1008" name="noteref_1008" href="#note_1008"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1008</span></span></a> To this spot were
attached some remarkable traditions of the Cretan worshippers
of Apollo, forming a branch of the colonization of
Cirrha; which is alluded to in Homer's account of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Thracians' bringing Rhadamanthus to Eubœa for
the purpose of seeing Tityus;<a id="noteref_1009" name="noteref_1009" href="#note_1009"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1009</span></span></a>—a remarkable
passage, which I can only understand to mean that the
Cretan hero was desirous to see Tityus, who was vanquished
by Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tegyra was a place of great importance in the
Bœotian tradition, as being the birthplace of Apollo.<a id="noteref_1010" name="noteref_1010" href="#note_1010"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1010</span></span></a> The Delphian oracle was more favourable to this
tradition than to that of Delos. Pindar<a id="noteref_1011" name="noteref_1011" href="#note_1011"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1011</span></span></a> represents
the youthful god as coming to take possession of Pytho
from Tegyra, not, as the Attic poets, from Delos.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_12" id="Book_II_Chapter_II_Section_12" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
12. The identity of the Bœotian with the Delphian
worship of Apollo was particularly striking in the
temple of Ismene at Thebes. As at Delphi the Python
was slain and the laurel broken anew every eight
years, so at Thebes a procession of laurel-bearers took
place at the same periods, the use of which, as a measure
of time, is evident.<a id="noteref_1012" name="noteref_1012" href="#note_1012"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1012</span></span></a>

statue of Athene was placed in front of the temple
(πρόναος).<a id="noteref_1013" name="noteref_1013" href="#note_1013"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1013</span></span></a> Tripods were the sacred vessels in both
temples, though never employed in the latter for the
purpose of prophecy. In later times the priests were
contented with observing omens from the flame and
ashes of sacrifices,<a id="noteref_1014" name="noteref_1014" href="#note_1014"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1014</span></span></a> like the πυρχόοι of Delphi;<a id="noteref_1015" name="noteref_1015" href="#note_1015"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1015</span></span></a> although

the mode of delivering oracles, from a mental
enthusiasm, was prevalent also in Thebes at an earlier
period; at least Tiresias (whom we may consider as a
prophet of the temple of Ismene)<a id="noteref_1016" name="noteref_1016" href="#note_1016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a> does not, either in
Homer or the tragedians, appear as a diviner from fire.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That, however, the whole worship of Apollo was
not one of those originally instituted at Thebes, will be
evident from the following observations. In the ancient
legends respecting Cadmus, in which Demeter,
Cora, Cadmus, and afterwards Bacchus, predominate
in succession, Apollo never appears in a conspicuous
character. For particular additions of the poets may
be easily distinguished from the genuine popular tradition.
The fable, that Cadmus, after the slaughter
of the serpent, was, like Apollo, compelled to live
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eight</span></em> years in slavery,<a id="noteref_1017" name="noteref_1017" href="#note_1017"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1017</span></span></a> must be considered as a poetical
transposition. Cadmus and Apollo had originally no
points of resemblance to each other. The situation of
the temple of Apollo at Thebes is a most convincing
proof that his worship was totally distinct from any
other. Those of the ancient national gods were built
on the citadel of Cadmeia, whilst Apollo was not only
not worshipped in the citadel, but even without the
gates, in the temple of Ismene,<a id="noteref_1018" name="noteref_1018" href="#note_1018"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1018</span></span></a> which, according to
Pausanias, must have been situated opposite to the
temple of Hercules and the house of Amphitryon.
This proximity of the hero and god, as well as all
other points of union between the two at Thebes, will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be employed for the purpose of establishing further
conclusions, when we explain the legend of Hercules.<a id="noteref_1019" name="noteref_1019" href="#note_1019"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1019</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To settle with any accuracy, from the traditions
concerning Tiresias and Hercules, the time at which
the Bœotian temples of Apollo were founded, seems
hardly possible, since the former contain no chronological
information, and the latter are entirely unconnected
with the rest of the Theban mythology. A
tradition respecting the establishment of the festival
of the Daphnephoria places it at the time of the
Æolian migration,<a id="noteref_1020" name="noteref_1020" href="#note_1020"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1020</span></span></a> whence it might perhaps be inferred
that the Æolians introduced the worship of
Apollo into Bœotia. This hypothesis would however
involve us in endless perplexities; and it is most probable
that its diffusion was gradually effected, soon
after the settlement at Cirrha, about the time at which
the worship of Apollo rose to importance at Athens.

13. The introduction of this worship into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Attica</span></span>
coincides exactly with the passage of the Ionians into
that country. The traditions respecting the most ancient
kings, Cecrops, Erichthonius, and Erechtheus,
chiefly refer to the temples, symbols, and festival rites
of Athene; and this goddess, together with the other
deities of the Acropolis, plays the principal part in
them, particularly in her connexion with the blessings
of husbandry. But with the reign of Ion the Attic
mythology assumes quite a different character.<a id="noteref_1021" name="noteref_1021" href="#note_1021"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1021</span></span></a> This
seems to me a complete refutation of the assertion of
the Ionians as to their identity with the aboriginal
nation of the Pelasgians.<a id="noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022" href="#note_1022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a> Still more evident is it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then, that in proportion as the Ionians, being a warlike
nation,<a id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023" href="#note_1023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1023</span></span></a> separated themselves from the original inhabitants,
whose employment was agriculture and pasturing,
their Hellenic worship deviated from the
ancient one of the country. Aristotle indeed speaks
of the paternal Apollo (Ἀπόλλων πατρῷος) as being
a son of Athene and Hephæstus;<a id="noteref_1024" name="noteref_1024" href="#note_1024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1024</span></span></a> but this is nothing
more than an endeavour to create a family connexion
between the principal gods of the same town: for
where do we ever find a temple dedicated conjointly to
Athene and Apollo? what ceremonies and sacrifices
were offered to them in common? and in what legends
are they found connected? Till such an union of the
two deities is discovered, we must consider Athene as
an ancient and native deity, Apollo as one of much
later introduction. The Athenians, indeed, maintained
that an ancient hero of their country, Erysichthon, a
son of Cecrops himself, erected the first statue of
Apollo at Delos:<a id="noteref_1025" name="noteref_1025" href="#note_1025"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1025</span></span></a> but it is easy to recognise in this
account the attempt of the Athenians to fortify their
claims to the dominion of the Delian temple, and to
represent their rights as prior to all others. In all
that is related of the Ionian princes (to whom Ægeus<a id="noteref_1026" name="noteref_1026" href="#note_1026"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1026</span></span></a>
and Theseus belong) with reference to religious institutions,
mention is seldom made of the ancient Athenian
deities, Athene and Hephæstus. The whole is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
taken up with accounts either of the establishment of
the worship of Poseidon (which prevailed in the Ionian
cities and in the places of their national assemblies),
or the establishment and maintenance of an intercourse
with the temples of Apollo at Delos, Delphi, and
Cnosus.

14. In the second place, the fabulous history of
these heroes also concerns the worship of Apollo, in
so far as the origin of the Pythian Theorias is contained
in it. Ion is even a real son or adopted disciple
of the Pythian god; and in all probability there was
no more difference originally between his two fathers,
Apollo and Xuthus,<a id="noteref_1027" name="noteref_1027" href="#note_1027"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1027</span></span></a> than between the two fathers of

This temple was manifestly built on the frontiers in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
order to afford a resting-place to the sacred procession,
which in the beginning of the spring went from
Athens to Pytho. For if favourable omens had been
observed in the town itself, and it was intended to despatch
the procession, the prophet in the Pythium at
Œnoë performed sacrifices every day, in order to procure
a favourable journey, just as the Delian procession
was regulated by omens observed in the Delium
at Marathon.<a id="noteref_1033" name="noteref_1033" href="#note_1033"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1033</span></span></a> The families charged with the preparations

Greece. The Pythaistæ took their station in the

Olympieium and Pythium, both of which were among
the earliest sanctuaries, although they first owed their
magnificence to Pisistratus.<a id="noteref_1035" name="noteref_1035" href="#note_1035"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1035</span></span></a> From this spot it was

and it was only in case the wished-for lightnings
flashed favourably over the heights that the embassy
could proceed along the Pythian road. This road led
from Athens, near mount Corydallus (on which there
was a temple of Apollo),<a id="noteref_1037" name="noteref_1037" href="#note_1037"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1037</span></span></a> through the Eleusinian

plain to Œnoë; from thence through the pass of Dryoscephalæ
to Bœotia, where it touched either Thespiæ
or Thebes, then Lebadeia and Chæronea, and then
passed on by Panopeus and Daulis through the defile
between Parnassus and Cirphis to Delphi: a mountain
road which the Athenians declared that they had themselves
opened,<a id="noteref_1038" name="noteref_1038" href="#note_1038"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1038</span></span></a> and which Theseus is said to have freed

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There still remains to be mentioned a remarkable
fact respecting Œnoë, which will greatly assist us in
explaining the fable of the voyage of Theseus to Crete:
I allude to the existence of a tomb of Androgeus, the
son of Minos, whom the natives had put to death as he
was passing on the Pythian road.<a id="noteref_1041" name="noteref_1041" href="#note_1041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1041</span></span></a> A Cretan was
murdered in the sacred way of the Cretan worship;
Minos came to take vengeance for the violation of the
sacred armistice; and hence Athens was obliged to
send a tribute to Cnosus. Now the nature of this
tribute may be perceived from a tradition preserved by
Aristotle,<a id="noteref_1042" name="noteref_1042" href="#note_1042"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1042</span></span></a> that the boys who were sent to Crete by
the Athenians lived at Cnosus as slaves; and that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
afterwards, when the Cretans, in consequence of an
ancient vow, sent a tithe of men to Delphi, the descendants
of these slaves went with them, and subsequently
passed from thence to Italy. From this it
appears that the Athenians were compelled to send
sacred slaves to the chief temple at Cnosus, viz., that
of Apollo. For this reason these missions took place
every eight years (δι᾽ ἐννέα ἐτῶν);<a id="noteref_1043" name="noteref_1043" href="#note_1043"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1043</span></span></a> that is, probably
at every Ennaëteris of the Cretan and Delphic festival;
and for the same reason they consisted of seven
young men and women, as this number was especially
sacred to Apollo.<a id="noteref_1044" name="noteref_1044" href="#note_1044"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1044</span></span></a>

It is well known how much this tradition was
disfigured by the Athenians (originally perhaps in
their popular legends, and afterwards by the poets),
in what an odious light it was represented, and so
mixed up with extraneous matter, that we should only
render the problem too difficult if we attempted to
investigate the whole of its component parts.

We may however affirm with certainty that the
voyage of Theseus to Crete had originally no other
meaning than the landings at Naxos<a id="noteref_1045" name="noteref_1045" href="#note_1045"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1045</span></span></a> and Delos, which
were connected with it—viz., a propagation of religious
worship.

moreover, the ship which conveyed Theseus home was
always regarded as a sacred vessel. It was sent out
at the Thargelia, after the priest, on the sixth day of
Thargelion, had crowned the poop.<a id="noteref_1047" name="noteref_1047" href="#note_1047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1047</span></span></a>

Amongst other Delian rites the worship of Eilithyia

One point at which the procession from
Attica to Crete touched was the borough town and
harbour of Prasiæ, on the eastern coast of Attica,
where, besides the temple of Apollo, was the tomb of
Erysichthon, the Delian and Athenian hero; and tradition
represented the gifts of the Hyperboreans to
have been transported from this port to that sacred
island.<a id="noteref_1049" name="noteref_1049" href="#note_1049"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1049</span></span></a>

Lastly, the origin of the Delphinian expiatory

introduction by the Ionian princes; for Ægeus dwelt
in the Delphinium, and was there buried. To him

15. The political situation of the worship of Apollo
at Athens still requires to be noticed. From our
previous observations it is clear that the Ionians had
adopted it from the Dorians; hence Ion himself is
called the son of the Pythian god. The paternal
deity of Athens was, as Demosthenes says, no other
than the Pythian Apollo.<a id="noteref_1052" name="noteref_1052" href="#note_1052"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1052</span></span></a> We may then assert,
without hesitation, that the Ionians were the only race
who had gentilitious rites of Apollo, and that they
alone could properly be called γενῆται Ἀπόλλωνος
πατρῴου. Thus, when the archons at the scrutiny
swore, that besides Zeus Herceus, the household god,
they worshipped also Apollo πατρῷος;<a id="noteref_1053" name="noteref_1053" href="#note_1053"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1053</span></span></a> this form of
oath originated at a time when the Eupatridæ, that
is, the noble Ionic and Hellenic families, were alone
eligible to the dignity of the archonship. Nor was it
till, by the timocracy of Solon and democracy of
Aristides, the richer class in general and the whole
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
people were admitted to this office, that Apollo πατρῷος
was considered as a deity common to all families.<a id="noteref_1054" name="noteref_1054" href="#note_1054"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1054</span></span></a>
The democratical judges of Athens also yearly
took an oath before this deity:<a id="noteref_1055" name="noteref_1055" href="#note_1055"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1055</span></span></a> this ceremony was
at first perhaps only required of the criminal judges
of aristocratical descent, viz., the Ephetæ. It is however
clear that originally the religion of Apollo was
adapted for the military caste alone, the ancient
Hopletes; hence he was not a god of artisans and
husbandmen, but of warriors. Hence also Ion or
Xuthus adopted him as the Athenian god of war
(πολέμαρχος) at the festival of Boedromia,<a id="noteref_1056" name="noteref_1056" href="#note_1056"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1056</span></span></a> the name
of which is derived from the onset of armed troops
in battle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As originally the Eupatridæ alone cultivated the
worship of Apollo, they alone possessed the ceremony
of purification, which is here, as elsewhere, mixed up
with the rites of the Cretan worship. According to
Plutarch,<a id="noteref_1057" name="noteref_1057" href="#note_1057"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1057</span></span></a> Ion had instructed the Athenians in
religion, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in that of Apollo; and the same author
relates,<a id="noteref_1058" name="noteref_1058" href="#note_1058"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1058</span></span></a> that Theseus established the Eupatridæ as
administrators of the government, judges, and interpreters
of the sacred rites (ἐξηγηταὶ ὁσίων καὶ ἱερῶν).
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By this we are to understand that it was their duty
to give information respecting every thing which regarded
the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">jus sacrum</span></span>; which in ancient times
especially comprehended expiations and excommunications
for homicide. The rites necessary at purification
were also entirely in the hands of the Eupatridæ,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have been induced to place these points in as
strong a light as possible, from the democratical tendency
of Athenian poetry, which endeavoured to obliterate
all traces of the forcible occupation of Attica,
and of the foreign extraction of the families of the
Eupatridæ. On this account the vacant period between
the times of the Erecthidæ and Ægidæ was
notoriously supplied by arbitrary insertions, and the
fable of Ion represented in a thousand various ways.
This tendency is also recognised in the tragedy of
Ion by Euripides, the artful and ingenious plan of
which cannot be sufficiently admired. According to
the ancient tradition, Ion was the son of the hero
Xuthus, or of the Pythian Apollo (who were originally
considered as identical), and probably of
Creusa, a native of Attica, which was a mode of
expressing his new settlement there. Euripides, on
the other hand, separates Ion from Xuthus,<a id="noteref_1061" name="noteref_1061" href="#note_1061"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1061</span></span></a> who is
always represented as somewhat rude and coarse, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even tyrannical,<a id="noteref_1062" name="noteref_1062" href="#note_1062"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1062</span></span></a> and so alters the whole story, that
the hero does not appear as a newcomer, but as
the legitimate offspring of the female line of the race
of the Erecthidæ. By this device the poet preserved
the idea that the Athenians were an aboriginal
nation, on which they so prided themselves,<a id="noteref_1063" name="noteref_1063" href="#note_1063"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1063</span></span></a> and set
aside, in a manner most agreeable to their feelings,
the fable which contradicted this claim to antiquity.
Ion himself in the tragedy gives utterance to some
very popular sentiments; and of the power of aristocracy,
once so firmly established, the last faint memorial
is almost buried in oblivion.<a id="noteref_1064" name="noteref_1064" href="#note_1064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1064</span></span></a>

1. We now come to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em> epoch of the propagation
of the worship of Apollo. The first embraced
the earliest migrations of the Doric nation, when the
great temples at Delphi, Cnosus, and Delos were
founded from Tempe. The second period is that of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the maritime supremacy of Minos, when the coasts of
Asia and Greece were covered with groves and expiatory
altars of this god. The third comprehends
the chief migration of the Dorians, and others occasioned
by it. Through these means Apollo became
the principal deity in Peloponnesus, where, in early
times, we find few traces of his existence. That the
Carnean Apollo of the Lacedæmonians, and the Apollo
Nomius of the Arcadians, form no exceptions to our
assertion, will be proved in a subsequent inquiry into
the nature and origin of these worships.<a id="noteref_1065" name="noteref_1065" href="#note_1065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1065</span></span></a>

After the Doric conquest of Peloponnesus, the chief
temples were every where consecrated to Apollo.
We have already spoken of the sanctuary of Apollo
Pythaëus, in which the Argive confederacy held their
meetings;<a id="noteref_1066" name="noteref_1066" href="#note_1066"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1066</span></span></a> nor was the temple of Apollo Lyceus in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The name of the Delphian god had now attained
throughout Peloponnesus the universal respect which
it so long enjoyed: it had even led the way to the settlement
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and conquest of that peninsula, and hence
Apollo was called by the Dorians their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leader</span></em> and

of Messenia (who upon the whole adhered less strictly
to the Doric customs than the Spartans) entered into a
connexion with the sanctuary at Delos, which had then
already fallen into the power of the Ionians. About
the fifth Olympiad (760 B.C.) Eumelus, the Corinthian
poet, composed an ode for a Messenian chorus to
that holy island.<a id="noteref_1078" name="noteref_1078" href="#note_1078"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1078</span></span></a> On the other hand, it was owing
to the Dorians (particularly to the Spartans) that the
Pythian sanctuary remained independent, in the hands
of the Delphians; to preserve it in this state was one
of the duties which they inherited from their fathers;<a id="noteref_1079" name="noteref_1079" href="#note_1079"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1079</span></span></a> and they protected it more than once, particularly
against the Athenians.

2. The political power of the Dorians over the
whole of Peloponnesus necessarily ensured the preponderance
of their religious institutions; nevertheless we
find that the Achæans and Arcadians possessed few
temples of Apollo, and those not the principal ones in
their cities.<a id="noteref_1080" name="noteref_1080" href="#note_1080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1080</span></span></a> The worship of Apollo was however,
through Spartan influence, held in great respect at
Tegea (the customs of which town had indeed become
almost entirely Doric), where there was also a tribe
called Apolloneatis.<a id="noteref_1081" name="noteref_1081" href="#note_1081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1081</span></span></a> The country moreover

hecatombs in the beginning of the spring),<a id="noteref_1082" name="noteref_1082" href="#note_1082"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1082</span></span></a> must have
been by this very circumstance induced to establish
temples in honour of Apollo, an instance of which
appears in that at Onceum.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principal deity of the Doric name soon obtained
a conspicuous place in the national festival, held
equally sacred by all Peloponnesians; I mean that of
Olympia. The establishment of this festival is probably
of early date; perhaps it took place during the
time when the dominion of the Pelopidæ spread from
Pisa and Olympia over most parts of the peninsula.
Hence the Elean Ætolians, when they seized upon the
presidency of these games, were, by the command of
the oracle, at the same time obliged to take one of the
Pelopidæ from the Achæan town of Helice for their
prince.<a id="noteref_1083" name="noteref_1083" href="#note_1083"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1083</span></span></a> Moreover, the ancient rivalry between the
Olympian and Isthmian worship, which occasioned the
prohibition against any Elean contending at the Isthmus,<a id="noteref_1084" name="noteref_1084" href="#note_1084"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1084</span></span></a>
can hardly have arisen at any other time
than when (previously to the Doric usurpation) the
Olympian Zeus was the chief god of the Achæans,<a id="noteref_1085" name="noteref_1085" href="#note_1085"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1085</span></span></a>
the Isthmian Poseidon of the Ionians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it was not till the Dorians, for the purpose of
assembling all the Peloponnesians, at least every four
years, under the protection of their god, had taken possession
of the temple at Olympia; nor till Iphitus the
Ætolian, and Lycurgus the Dorian, had renewed these
contests, or given them a greater degree of importance,
that Apollo and Zeus are found in connexion with
each other, and even contending in the course at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Olympia. And as a further instance of change, the
sacred armistice of Olympia went by the local name
of Therma;<a id="noteref_1086" name="noteref_1086" href="#note_1086"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1086</span></span></a> and hence Apollo, as the patron and
guardian deity of the institution, was called Thermius,
and worshipped under that title in the grove of Altis.<a id="noteref_1087" name="noteref_1087" href="#note_1087"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1087</span></span></a>
At this time Hercules (whose worship, once entirely
unknown in Elis, was introduced by Iphitus)<a id="noteref_1088" name="noteref_1088" href="#note_1088"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1088</span></span></a> is
also reported to have brought the wild olive-tree from the
Hyperboreans to the Alpheus, and planted the sacred
grove of Altis with it.<a id="noteref_1089" name="noteref_1089" href="#note_1089"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1089</span></span></a> The important influence of
the Delphian oracle on the Olympian games also
occasioned the time of their celebration to be regulated
by the Pythian cycle of eight years.<a id="noteref_1090" name="noteref_1090" href="#note_1090"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1090</span></span></a> For whereas the
whole cycle of eight years consisted of ninety-nine
lunar months, at the expiration of which time the
revolutions of the moon and sun again nearly coincided;
this period was at Olympia divided into two unequal
parts of fifty and forty-nine months, so that the festival
took place sometimes in the month of Apollonius,
sometimes in Parthenius.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The introduction of the worship of Apollo must
have had no less influence on the families of the soothsayers,
who ministered at the altars of the Olympic
deities. These were the Clytiadæ, Iamidæ, and Telliadæ;<a id="noteref_1091" name="noteref_1091" href="#note_1091"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1091</span></span></a>

3. The Doric migration gave rise to many others,
which spread the worship of Apollo in various directions;
no longer, however, as a peculiar deity of the
Dorians and Cretans, but, in a more extended sense,
as the national god of the Greeks. This was chiefly
occasioned by the influence of Delphi, which seems to
have given the chief stimulus to that great migration.
In fact, it became from this time invested with a power
which hardly belonged to any subsequent institution.
Apollo is represented as governing nations with an
arbitrary power, compelling them, however unwilling,
to undertake distant expeditions, and pointing out the
settlements which they are to occupy. In order to
convey a more distinct idea of this singular phenomenon,
it is necessary that the condition of the immediate
subjects of the Pythian temple should be more closely
examined.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the district of the Cirrhæans had, by the
Amphictyonic war, become forfeited to the temple of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Delphi, the sacred lands belonging to it formed a very
considerable territory. Two inscriptions contain surveys
of the Hieromnemons respecting its boundaries:
one relating to those towards Anticirrha in the east,
the other to those in the direction of Amphissa to the
west.<a id="noteref_1094" name="noteref_1094" href="#note_1094"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1094</span></span></a> Now it certainly appears that in ancient times,
when Cirrha was in existence, none of these lands
belonged to the temple, which must therefore have
possessed little or no territory. But in spite of the
generally received accounts of the Amphictyonic war,
it can be satisfactorily proved, that in earlier times
Cirrha and the temple, with its appendages, formed
one state.<a id="noteref_1095" name="noteref_1095" href="#note_1095"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1095</span></span></a> Their territory indeed consisted for the
most part of rock, mountain, and narrow glens;<a id="noteref_1096" name="noteref_1096" href="#note_1096"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1096</span></span></a> yet
towards the south it embraced the spacious plain of
Crissa, and in the north at least the luxuriant vineyards
of Parnassus. By whom then was this territory cultivated?
certainly neither by the Doric nobles nor the
Cretan colonists, who in the Homeric hymn are derided
by the god for thinking of the labours of agriculture,
and commanded to employ themselves merely in
sacrificing victims.<a id="noteref_1097" name="noteref_1097" href="#note_1097"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1097</span></span></a> Thus it is evident,
that there were subjects of the temple, who, besides the humble
employment of cultivating the soil, were also obliged
to tend the herds belonging to the temple. These
were the servants of the temple whom we so frequently
find mentioned.<a id="noteref_1098" name="noteref_1098" href="#note_1098"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1098</span></span></a> The same class also existed in Crete,
as we have before proved from the tribute sent by
Athens; and Crete, in its turn, as well as Eretria and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Magnesia,<a id="noteref_1099" name="noteref_1099" href="#note_1099"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1099</span></span></a> sent such <span class="tei tei-q">“human firstlings”</span> to the
temple of Pytho. Mention is also made of a town in
Crete composed of a thousand men, all sacred slaves.<a id="noteref_1100" name="noteref_1100" href="#note_1100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1100</span></span></a>
Now these slaves of Delphi may have been procured
in different ways, either as tribute (and that either of
a city or of individuals), as voluntary bondsmen, or by
purchase:<a id="noteref_1101" name="noteref_1101" href="#note_1101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1101</span></span></a> the latter mode was probably of rare occurrence
in early times. There still remain a considerable
number of Delphian monuments, in which
private individuals present or sell to the god those
slaves whom they wish to favour.<a id="noteref_1102" name="noteref_1102" href="#note_1102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1102</span></span></a> The condition of
these vassals corresponds to that of the Doric bondsmen;<a id="noteref_1103" name="noteref_1103" href="#note_1103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1103</span></span></a> but their servitude was probably of a milder
nature; for we find it frequently stated that the sacred
slaves lived inviolate under the protection of the god,
although (at least in early times) they were entirely
dependent on the sacred council of the temple.
Originally, a great part consisted of prisoners taken
in war. We collect from ancient epic poems that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Manto the daughter of Tiresias was, after the war of
the Epigoni, sent to the Pythian god as a share of the
spoil<a id="noteref_1104" name="noteref_1104" href="#note_1104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1104</span></span></a>
(ἀκροθίνιον): one individual, as is usual in the
language of mythology, standing for many. The
Gephyræans also are said to have been at that time
decimated, sent from Thebes to Delphi, and thus to
have arrived at Athens.<a id="noteref_1105" name="noteref_1105" href="#note_1105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1105</span></span></a> After the Persian war, an
idea was actually entertained of reviving this punishment
against the Thebans, whose enemies considered
them, at a still later period, as in the eye of justice
decimated, and given as slaves to Apollo.<a id="noteref_1106" name="noteref_1106" href="#note_1106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1106</span></span></a>

4. When the Pythian god was either unwilling or
unable to retain within his territory the crowds who
had been collected in this manner, he sent them out
as colonists; without, however, entirely giving up all
claim to their obedience. The early Grecian history
affords several examples of this proceeding: the
earliest is a Doric tradition respecting the Dryopes,
which differs in some respect from their own account.
Hercules, here represented as a Doric hero, had subjugated
the Dryopes, and brought them to Delphi as
an offering to Apollo, by whom he was commanded to
settle them on the southern coast of Argolis.<a id="noteref_1107" name="noteref_1107" href="#note_1107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1107</span></span></a> That
this nation, probably of Pelasgic origin, did not in
early times worship the Doric god, is evident from the
tradition that Leogoras the Dryopian violated the
temple of Apollo.<a id="noteref_1108" name="noteref_1108" href="#note_1108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1108</span></span></a> But it is equally certain that they
were henceforth compelled to serve Apollo as their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chief deity, especially in his character of Apollo Pythaëus

at Delphi, where it is frequently mentioned in
later times under the name of Craugallidæ, who, together
with the Cirrhæans, appear as enemies to the
temple;<a id="noteref_1110" name="noteref_1110" href="#note_1110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1110</span></span></a> from which circumstance it may be inferred
that most of these Cirrhæans were revolted subjects
of the temple.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The migration of the Magnesians approaches rather
nearer to the historical age. This race, dwelling
under mount Pelion, felt itself, about the time of the
Thessalian migration, so pressed for want of territory,
that it had recourse to the Delphian oracle, by whose

These young colonists were mostly despatched to the
worshippers of Apollo in Crete, where they founded
the town of Magnesia, which Plato speaks of as a
place that had been destroyed, and considers as a prototype
of his ideal state, Apollo having been its only

of Asia Minor soon carried over these sojourners to
the banks of the Mæander and the Lethæus, at the
confluence of which rivers they had been settled some
time before the Ionic migration;<a id="noteref_1114" name="noteref_1114" href="#note_1114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1114</span></span></a> being, as was afterwards

this worship. Pausanias<a id="noteref_1118" name="noteref_1118" href="#note_1118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1118</span></span></a> gives an account of this

5. These events, which from their connected form
cannot be poetical fictions, give some idea of the extensive
influence of the temple of Delphi, the power
of which was probably at its highest pitch in the time
immediately succeeding the Doric migrations. Hence
also this was the epoch of the greatest influence of
the Amphictyons of Thermopylæ;<a id="noteref_1126" name="noteref_1126" href="#note_1126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1126</span></span></a> which confederation
of Thessalian tribes, and of tribes derived from
Thessaly, united the worship of the Doric temple of
Apollo with that of Demeter at Thermopylæ, and
thus an Hellenic and ancient Pelasgic worship were
combined together,<a id="noteref_1127" name="noteref_1127" href="#note_1127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1127</span></span></a> probably not without a view of
forming a more intimate union between the different
races of Greece. The assembling in the spring of the
year at Delphi was probably copied from the meeting
of the neighbouring towns, in the spring festival, at
Tempe, at which business of a political kind was sometimes
transacted.<a id="noteref_1128" name="noteref_1128" href="#note_1128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1128</span></span></a> The power, however, of the Amphictyons
of Thermopylæ was at no time actually
political, and, with a very few exceptions, all their
regulations and undertakings concerned the protection
of the two temples in their rights and possessions, the
rights of other temples in Greece, and the maintenance
of some principles of international law (νόμοι Ἀμφικτυονικοὶ),

7. The principal places to be mentioned in Italy
besides Rhegium are Croton and Metapontum. The
former was an Achæan and Lacedæmonian colony;
in the founding of which, according to tradition, the
oracle had an important share;<a id="noteref_1138" name="noteref_1138" href="#note_1138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1138</span></span></a> the memory of which is preserved
by temples of Apollo Pythius, Hyperboreus,<a id="noteref_1139" name="noteref_1139" href="#note_1139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1139</span></span></a>

Croton was peculiarly subject to the influence of
Apollo, whose worship operated to an unusual extent
on the character and customs of its inhabitants. On
the founding of Metapontum our information is scanty.
The inhabitants generally supposed themselves to be
of Achæan origin; yet Ephorus has preserved a remarkable,
though confused tradition, that Daulius the tyrant
of Crissa was the founder of that town.<a id="noteref_1141" name="noteref_1141" href="#note_1141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1141</span></span></a> It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seems, then, that inhabitants of Daulis, in the narrow
valley of Parnassus, and Crissæans, from the coast,
had passed over to Italy in very early times. The
inhabitants of Metapontum, as ancient subjects of
Apollo, sent him golden ears of corn (χρυσοῦν θέρος)
as a tithe of their harvest; we find on their coins the
full ears of barley, which were paid as tribute, and on
the reverse the god himself, armed with his helmet,
arrow and bow, as a conqueror, and holding a branch
of laurel; exactly coinciding with the symbols used
in the temple of Delphi.<a id="noteref_1142" name="noteref_1142" href="#note_1142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1142</span></span></a> Thus historical tradition and religious symbols

During the period of which we are treating, the

the chief instrument which extended the worship of

erected on the coast an altar of Apollo Archegetas,

37), was already considered as the same with the
Dorian god; hence the fountain of Apollo at Cyrene,
its colony of Apollonia, &amp;c. Mythology, which often
first clothes the events of history in a fabulous garb,
and then refers them to an early and unknown time,
expressed the founding of Cyrene, under the guidance
of the temple of Apollo, in the following elegant personification—That
Cyrene, a Thessalian nymph, the
favourite of Apollo, was carried by her divine lover to
Africa, in his chariot drawn by swans.<a id="noteref_1148" name="noteref_1148" href="#note_1148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1148</span></span></a>

We shall abstain from bringing down the colonization
of this religion to a later period, since in
after-times the lively principle which at first actuated
the worshippers of Apollo was lost; and, instead
of considering their actions as the effect of supernatural
compulsion, men were rather disposed to
regulate their conduct according to the dictates of
reason and free-will.

1. Wearisome as it is to follow up the chain of

We assert, then, the connexion of this tradition
with the original worship of Apollo. No argument
to the contrary can be drawn from its not being mentioned
either in the Iliad or Odyssey; these poems
not affording any opportunity for its introduction.
Moreover, the Hyperboreans were spoken of in the
poem of the Epigoni, and by Hesiod.<a id="noteref_1149" name="noteref_1149" href="#note_1149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1149</span></span></a> The fable,
indeed, may not have come till late within the province

have arisen whilst that primitive connexion between
the temples of Tempe, Delphi, and Delos (which was

vigour.

adorned the new-born god with a golden fillet and
lyre, and sent him, in a chariot drawn by swans,
to Delphi, in order to introduce justice and law
amongst the Greeks. Apollo, however, ordered the
swans first to fly to the Hyperboreans. The Delphians,
missing the god, instituted a pæan and song,
ranged choruses of young men around the tripod,
and invoked him to come from the Hyperboreans.
The god remained an entire year with that nation,
and at the appointed time, when the tripods of
Delphi were destined to sound, he ordered the swans
to resume their flight. The return of Apollo takes
place exactly in the middle of summer; nightingales,
swallows, and grasshoppers sing in honour
of the god; and even Castalia and Cephisus<a id="noteref_1155" name="noteref_1155" href="#note_1155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1155</span></span></a> heave

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pæan, to the worship of the Delphian god, he would
hardly have dared to do more than embellish the local
traditions. Supposing, however, that this was not
the case, he would still have taken the principal event
(viz., the arrival of Apollo from the Hyperboreans)
rather from a fable universally acknowledged, than
the unauthorized fictions of poetry. The whole account,
and even the time, are clearly drawn from the
mysteries of the worship. According to the tradition
of Delphi, Apollo, at the expiration of the great
period, visited the beloved nation of the Hyperboreans,
and danced and played with them from the vernal
equinox to the early setting of the Pleiades; and
when the first corn was cut in Greece, he returned
to Delphi, as I suppose, with the full ripe ears, the
offerings of the Hyperboreans.<a id="noteref_1156" name="noteref_1156" href="#note_1156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1156</span></span></a> Even the story of
the swans was no addition of Alcæus; for the painted
vases in the south of Italy (the extremity of the
Grecian world) represent the same fiction as the
Lesbian poet; nay, so exactly do they correspond,
that we do not indeed recognise Alcæus, but the traditions
upon which the account was founded, as they
were perhaps related at Metapontum and Croton.
The boy Apollo, the sceptre and goblet in one
hand, and full ears of barley in the other (which
allude to the offerings of the Hyperboreans, and the
<span class="tei tei-q">“golden summer”</span>), is seated, with a mild aspect,
on a car, the axles of which are bound with swans'
feathers. Hyperborean women, with torches, and
pitchers for sacred libations, conduct him.<a id="noteref_1157" name="noteref_1157" href="#note_1157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1157</span></span></a> The

swans, with which Apollo here comes, occur elsewhere
in the legends of Delphi, which refer to the Hyperboreans.
The most ancient temple of Delphi, according
to the assertion of the priests, was merely
a low hut, built with branches of the sacred laurel
of Tempe; the second was a tent, which either the
Hyperboreans or Pteras of Crete formed of swans'
feathers and wax.<a id="noteref_1158" name="noteref_1158" href="#note_1158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1158</span></span></a> The Peneus flowed by the altar

local alterations, at Delos.<a id="noteref_1160" name="noteref_1160" href="#note_1160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1160</span></span></a> Latona, in the first
place, is said to have arrived in that island from the
country of the Hyperboreans as a she-wolf, having
completed the whole journey, pursued by Here, in
twelve days and nights.<a id="noteref_1161" name="noteref_1161" href="#note_1161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1161</span></span></a> Afterwards the young
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
virgins, Arge and Opis, came with Apollo and
Artemis; a lofty tomb was erected to their memory
at Delos, upon which sacrifices were offered; an
ancient hymn, which was attributed to the ancient
minstrel Olen, celebrated their appearance.<a id="noteref_1162" name="noteref_1162" href="#note_1162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1162</span></span></a> Afterwards
the Hyperboreans sent two other virgins,
Hyperoche and Laodice, the same names as occur
above, and with them five men, who are called
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">perpherees</span></span><a id="noteref_1163" name="noteref_1163" href="#note_1163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1163</span></span></a>
(from their bringing the sacred gifts enveloped
in wheaten straw): this exactly corresponds
with <span class="tei tei-q">“the golden summer”</span> of the Delphians. The
perpherees received great honours at Delos; and
the Delian maidens before marriage laid on the
tomb of the two Hyperborean virgins a spindle, the
young men a branch, both entwined with locks of
hair. The offering, however, of the Hyperborean
women was, it was said, really intended for Ilithyia,
the protectress of women in labour, in order to fulfil
a vow made to that goddess for the birth of Apollo
and Artemis. Now these missions, according to
Delian traditions, always continued to be carried on.
The Hyperboreans were supposed to pass them on
to their neighbours the Scythians; from them they
were transmitted through a chain of nations on the
coast of the Adriatic, by Dodona,<a id="noteref_1164" name="noteref_1164" href="#note_1164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1164</span></span></a> through Thessaly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Eubœa, and the island of Tenos, and came
accompanied with flutes and pipes,<a id="noteref_1165" name="noteref_1165" href="#note_1165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1165</span></span></a> to Delos.<a id="noteref_1166" name="noteref_1166" href="#note_1166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1166</span></span></a>
This story cannot have been a mere poetical fiction;
it doubtless originated in the active connexion kept
up by means of sacred missions with the ancient
settlements of the worship of Apollo in the north
of Thessaly.<a id="noteref_1167" name="noteref_1167" href="#note_1167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1167</span></span></a>
In Delos also, as at Delphi, there was
a story of the god resting for some time amongst
the Hyperboreans; though the scene was generally
changed to Lycia.<a id="noteref_1168" name="noteref_1168" href="#note_1168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1168</span></span></a> A painted vase exhibits the god
with a lyre in his hand, alighting near the palm-tree

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the temple at Olympia was connected with
Delphi, we find also here some traditions respecting
the country of the Hyperboreans, as the native land
of the wild olive-tree which flourished in the grove

4. Thus much concerning the places where the
fable of the Hyperboreans really existed; we must
next notice the situation generally assigned to that
sacred nation. In this the name is our chief guide.
In the first place it indicates a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">northern</span></em> nation;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which idea is sufficiently accounted for by the fact
that the worship of Apollo came from the most
northern part of Greece, from the district of Tempe;<a id="noteref_1170" name="noteref_1170" href="#note_1170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1170</span></span></a>
and although the actual distance was not great, yet
the imagination might have been moved by this circumstance
to conceive Apollo as coming from the
most remote regions of the north. But, in the second
place, the Hyperboreans are said to dwell <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beyond</span></em>
Boreas; so that this happy nation never felt the
cold north wind: in the same manner that Homer
represents the summit of Olympus as rising above
the storms, nor ever covered with snow, but surrounded
by an atmosphere of cloudless and undisturbed
serenity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. This is nearly the whole of our information
on the origin of this fabulous people. Poets, however,
and geographers, dissatisfied with such accounts,
attempted to assign to it a fixed habitation in the
catalogue of nations: and for this purpose connected
multifarious and foreign accounts of the northern
regions of the world with the religious fable of the
Hyperboreans, and moulded the whole into an imaginary
picture of a supposed real people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among these stories the most remarkable is that
which connects the Hyperboreans with the Scythians.
Herodotus found them mentioned in the Arimaspea of
Aristeas the Proconnesian, in which poem his ideas
of the worship of Apollo were interspersed with obscure
accounts of the northern regions.<a id="noteref_1171" name="noteref_1171" href="#note_1171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1171</span></span></a> He came,
led by the spirit of Apollo, through Scythia to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Issedones,<a id="noteref_1172" name="noteref_1172" href="#note_1172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1172</span></span></a> the one-eyed Arimaspians, the Griffins that
kept watch over the gold, and thus at last reached the
Hyperboreans who inhabited the shores on the further
side of the ocean. Now Aristeas must have collected
the tradition concerning these nations and monsters
from the same sources as Herodotus; viz., from the
Greeks dwelling on the Pontus and Borysthenes, and
through these from the Scythians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the list of the fabulous nations of the north, the
ancient Damastes exactly agrees with the Arimaspea
of Aristeas.<a id="noteref_1173" name="noteref_1173" href="#note_1173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1173</span></span></a> Beyond the Scythians he places the Issedones,
then the Arimaspians, then the Rhipæan mountains,
from which the north wind blows, and on the
other side of these, on the sea-coast, the Hyperboreans.<a id="noteref_1174" name="noteref_1174" href="#note_1174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1174</span></span></a>
Without doubt this geographer placed the Issedones
in the districts to the north of the Euxine sea, and
rather to the east of Greece.<a id="noteref_1175" name="noteref_1175" href="#note_1175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1175</span></span></a> And indeed neither
Issedones, Arimaspians, nor Griffins could be placed
in any other region than that which lies to the north of
the Euxine sea, as all this tract had become known to
the Greeks by means of the Scythians, who dwelt in
these parts; it was only in this district that the Greeks
heard of Arimaspians. The case is entirely different
with respect to the Hyperboreans and Rhipæans. Of
the former the Scythians, as Herodotus tells us, knew
nothing; and the latter are a mere political fiction of
Greece, since they derived their names from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hurricanes</span></span>
(ῥιπαὶ), issuing from a cavern, which they warded off
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the Hyperboreans, and sent to more southern
nations. For this reason the Hyperboreans could also
be placed in another part, remote from Scythia; still
however they kept their original position in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">north</span></em>.
Thus Pindar,<a id="noteref_1176" name="noteref_1176" href="#note_1176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1176</span></span></a> and also Æschylus in the Prometheus
Unbound,<a id="noteref_1177" name="noteref_1177" href="#note_1177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1177</span></span></a> place the Hyperboreans at the source of the
Ister. Now, if, with Herodotus, the Ister is conceived
to be a river which runs through all Europe from its
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">western</span></em> extremity, the Hyperboreans, in spite of their
name, must be placed in the regions of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">west</span></em>.<a id="noteref_1178" name="noteref_1178" href="#note_1178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1178</span></span></a> But
there was in ancient times also an idea that the Ister
was a vast stream descending from the extreme <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">north</span></em>;<a id="noteref_1179" name="noteref_1179" href="#note_1179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1179</span></span></a>
and this notion was evidently entertained by the two
poets just mentioned; thus Æschylus, in the Prometheus
Unbound, represented Hercules as penetrating
to the place where Boreas rushes from the mountains;
and with this the Rhipæan mountains, the
Hyperboreans, and the Ister were doubtless mentioned.
Sophocles also placed the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ancient garden of
Phœbus</span></span>”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the country of the Hyperboreans, at
the extremity of the earth, and near the dwelling of
Boreas.<a id="noteref_1180" name="noteref_1180" href="#note_1180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1180</span></span></a> This natural conception of the Hyperboreans,
and agreeing so well with the origin of the legend, is
universal among the early poets; it is only in the works
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of later writers that we find certain traces of a translation
of the Hyperboreans to Italy and other western
countries, and of a confusion of the Rhipæans with the
Alps and Pyrenees.

6. We see then that notwithstanding the arbitrary
license assumed by poets, the religious ideas respecting
the Hyperboreans were every where preserved without
the slightest variation. They were represented as a
pious nation, abstaining from the flesh of animals, and
living in perpetual serenity, in the service of their god,
for a thousand years.<a id="noteref_1181" name="noteref_1181" href="#note_1181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1181</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“The muse,”</span> says Pindar,
<span class="tei tei-q">“is not estranged from their manners. The choruses
of virgins and sweet melody of the lyre or pipe resound
on every side; and, twining their hair with the
glittering laurel, they feast joyfully. Neither disease
nor old age is the lot of this sacred race; while
they live apart from toil and battles, undisturbed by
the revengeful Nemesis.”</span><a id="noteref_1182" name="noteref_1182" href="#note_1182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1182</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Respecting their festivals, which were supposed to
take place in the open air,<a id="noteref_1183" name="noteref_1183" href="#note_1183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1183</span></span></a> it was related by Hecatæus
the younger, of Abdera, that these were celebrated by
three gigantic Boreadæ, whose songs and dances were
accompanied by innumerable flocks of swans.<a id="noteref_1184" name="noteref_1184" href="#note_1184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1184</span></span></a> But
the strangest account is that of Pindar, that whole
hecatombs of asses were sacrificed at these festivals:<a id="noteref_1185" name="noteref_1185" href="#note_1185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1185</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this however is borrowed from the real worship, from
one of the sacred rites of Delphi, where asses were
sacrificed at the Pythian festival.<a id="noteref_1186" name="noteref_1186" href="#note_1186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1186</span></span></a> Lastly, the account
given of the death of the Hyperboreans strongly reminds
us of the rites of the Thargelia, and the leap at
Leucate; we are told that, tired of a long existence,
they leapt, crowned with garlands, from a rock into
the sea.<a id="noteref_1187" name="noteref_1187" href="#note_1187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1187</span></span></a>

1. Having treated of the extension and propagation
of the worship of Apollo, and some of the most
remarkable legends and fables connected with it, we
next turn our attention to the nature and character of
the religion itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place, then, we shall remind the reader
of a position sufficiently established by the foregoing
inquiries; that the Apollo of Tempe, Delphi, Delos,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Crete, Lycia, Troy, Athens, and Peloponnesus, is the
same god, and not, as was very frequently the case in
the religions of Greece, a combination of several
deities under one name. This conclusion we supported
as well by historical accounts respecting the foundation
of his numerous temples, as by the evidence derived
from a recurrence of the same names, rites, and symbols;
such, for example, as the titles of Lycius and
Lycia, Delphinius and Pythius; the oracles and sibyls;
the purifications and expiations; the custom of leaping
from rocks; decimations; the golden summer, and
bloodless oblations; the laurel-berries; the legend of
the Hyperboreans, and the cycle of eight years.
Hence the theologians mentioned by Cicero<a id="noteref_1188" name="noteref_1188" href="#note_1188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1188</span></span></a> were
wrong in endeavouring without any authority to distinguish
between the Athenian, Cretan, and Hyperborean
Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_II_Chapter_V_Section_2" id="Book_II_Chapter_V_Section_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. It appears, however, that they were warranted
in distinguishing from the rest the Apollo Nomius of
Arcadia; although in their etymology of the name,<a id="noteref_1189" name="noteref_1189" href="#note_1189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1189</span></span></a>
which made him a divine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lawgiver</span></em>, they by no means
followed the most authentic sources of religious history.
The correct account is without doubt that given by
Pindar,<a id="noteref_1190" name="noteref_1190" href="#note_1190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1190</span></span></a> who calls Aristæus, conjointly with Zeus and
Apollo, a protector of flocks, and guardian of huntsmen.
In fact, Aristæus and his son Actæon were
ancient deities of the early Pelasgic inhabitants of
Greece.<a id="noteref_1191" name="noteref_1191" href="#note_1191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1191</span></span></a> That god also protected agriculture and
pasturing, warded off the scorching heat of summer,
charmed by incantations the mild Etesian winds, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
loved hunting and the care of bees. His chief haunts
were the plains under mount Pelion and Iolcus—from
which place his worship was introduced into Cyrene—the
fertile valley of Thebes, Parrhasia in Arcadia,<a id="noteref_1192" name="noteref_1192" href="#note_1192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1192</span></span></a>
and the Parrhasian island of Ceos;<a id="noteref_1193" name="noteref_1193" href="#note_1193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1193</span></span></a> at Cyrene, Apollo
and Cyrene were called his parents.<a id="noteref_1194" name="noteref_1194" href="#note_1194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1194</span></span></a> The genealogy
attributed to Aristæus varied considerably in different
places; through the prevalence of Greek worship in
Arcadia he was considered identical with Apollo. It
was remembered that the Delphian god had also tended
the herds of Admetus; and perhaps the national
worship of Aristæus at Pheræ had partly contributed
to the formation of this fable.<a id="noteref_1195" name="noteref_1195" href="#note_1195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1195</span></span></a> Deities, whose worship
at an early period fell into disuse, were adapted and
modified in various ways to suit the ruling powers:
and even if a complete and consistent system of mythology
was eradicated and destroyed as a whole, yet
particular portions of it would combine themselves
with the prevailing religion, and thus obtain a new
existence. Thus also the ancient elementary deity,
which had received the name of Apollo Nomius, was
called the son of the ancient Silenus,<a id="noteref_1196" name="noteref_1196" href="#note_1196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1196</span></span></a> because his attributes
seemed to resemble those of the attendants of
Bacchus.<a id="noteref_1197" name="noteref_1197" href="#note_1197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1197</span></span></a> I shall take occasion hereafter to explain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the connexion between the Carnean Apollo and this
deity.<a id="noteref_1198" name="noteref_1198" href="#note_1198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1198</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. It should also be observed that Apollo and
Æsculapius were connected in fable and mythology;
and this at an early period, for Hesiod called Æsculapius
the son of Apollo;<a id="noteref_1199" name="noteref_1199" href="#note_1199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1199</span></span></a> but, as it
appears, only in mythology, and not in any religious worship. Thus
neither at Tricca, Lebadea, Epidaurus, nor Cos, were
Apollo Pæan and Æsculapius intimately connected;
nor do we ever find that they had altars, festivals, or
sacrifices in common, except perhaps in a temple at
the modern town of Megalopolis.<a id="noteref_1200" name="noteref_1200" href="#note_1200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1200</span></span></a> This practical
difference may be accounted for by the national origin
of the two worships. For Phlegyas, the ancestor of
Æsculapius, and the sons of Æsculapius mentioned in
the Homeric Catalogue, belonged to races which were
hostile both to the Dorians and the temple of Delphi;
and the dispersion of the schools of the Asclepiadæ
through Greece had nothing in common with the foundation
of the temples of Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_II_Chapter_V_Section_4" id="Book_II_Chapter_V_Section_4" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
4. Having made these distinctions, we now return
to the principal position established by the preceding
inquiries; viz., that it was the Dorians among whom
the religion of Apollo was the most ancient, important,
and truly national worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Dorians being an active and heroic people, it
is natural that their peculiar religious feelings should
have had a like tendency. Hence, as they displayed
a perpetual aversion to the innocent employments of
husbandry, and a love for active and military exertion,
their national god was exactly the reverse of the elementary
deities worshipped by the agricultural races.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this inference seems to be invalidated by an
opinion entertained by many at least of the later
Greeks, and by most modern writers on mythology,
that Apollo was an elementary deity, the deified personification
of the sun. On the whole of this difficult
and doubtful subject it is not my intention now to
enter; but I shall be satisfied with laying before the
reader the principal arguments on both sides, and
afterwards stating my own views on the subject.

5. In the first place, then, the accounts above given
of Apollo returning from the Hyperboreans with the
ripe ears of corn, and the tribute of the golden ears,
certainly suggest the idea of a guardian of agriculture.<a id="noteref_1201" name="noteref_1201" href="#note_1201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1201</span></span></a>
On the coins of Metapontum we frequently see these
ears of corn, with the grasshopper, or mouse both in
the act of creeping, upon the reverse. The same explanation
is applicable to both symbols. The mouse
and grasshopper are animals hurtful to the corn, which
the god was supplicated to protect from their attacks.
In like manner the Cretan Apollo Σμίνθειος was
doubtless a destroyer of field mice (σμίνθοι);<a id="noteref_1202" name="noteref_1202" href="#note_1202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1202</span></span></a> and his
statue was represented with one foot upon a mouse.<a id="noteref_1203" name="noteref_1203" href="#note_1203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1203</span></span></a>

Again, in Rhodes he was called ἐρυθίβιος, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
averter of mildew;”</span><a id="noteref_1204" name="noteref_1204" href="#note_1204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1204</span></span></a> which attribute was
peculiarly suitable to him, as being one of the Triopian deities,
one of whom was Demeter, the destroyer of Erysichthon.
These are probably the chief reasons which
can be adduced in favour of the position that Apollo
was an elementary deity; reasons which are founded
on the symbols and ceremonies of the real worship, and
not on the opinions of later philosophers. But, first,
the argument that Apollo was an elementary god, because
he was a patron and protector of agriculture, is
inconclusive; for he performs this office in his character
of guardian and averter of misfortune generally. The
case indeed would be otherwise, had Apollo been supposed
either to call forth the seed from the earth or
bring it to maturity; no trace however of these functions
being attributed to him ever occurs. It is therefore
unnecessary on this account to identify him with
the sun. And it may be remarked likewise, that the
chief festivals of Apollo were not connected with any
remarkable epochs of the sun's course, but rather with
the rising of the stars, particularly of the pleiads, and
with the phases of the moon. Thus the new moon
was sacred to Apollo, who hence received the name of
Νεομήνιος;<a id="noteref_1205" name="noteref_1205" href="#note_1205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1205</span></span></a> and so likewise the first quarter, or the
seventh day; and, finally, the full moon (διχομηνία),
particularly in the island of Zacynthus.<a id="noteref_1206" name="noteref_1206" href="#note_1206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1206</span></span></a> From
these circumstances, however, no one will infer that Apollo
was a god of the moon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We do not, however, deny that Apollo and the god
of the sun admitted in particular points of a comparison
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and parallel with each other; the source of external
light might be a symbol of the <span class="tei tei-q">“bright and pure”</span>
god; and indeed the Platonists favoured this supposition,<a id="noteref_1207" name="noteref_1207" href="#note_1207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1207</span></span></a>
which is not, however, supported by any historical
authority. The worship of the sun was practised
in the Acropolis of Corinth, at Rhodes, Athens,
and in earlier times also at Calauria and Tænarum;
but in none of these places was it connected with the
rites of Apollo.<a id="noteref_1208" name="noteref_1208" href="#note_1208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1208</span></span></a>

6. This naturally leads us to inquire how any ideal
connexion between Apollo and the sun, if it really existed,
should have been entirely overlooked for so many
centuries; how was it that these deities were not identified
till the Grecian mythology had ceased to have
any influence upon the ideas and feelings of mankind?
Even when the Egyptian interpreters identified Horus
with Apollo, they were in all probability guided only
by the resemblance between the destroyer of the Python
and the vanquisher of Baby (Typhon in Greek).<a id="noteref_1209" name="noteref_1209" href="#note_1209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1209</span></span></a>
The Persian magi, however, in discovering a connexion
between the worship of Apollo and their religion (on
which account Xerxes preserved from injury the
island where Apollo and Artemis were born),<a id="noteref_1210" name="noteref_1210" href="#note_1210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1210</span></span></a> were
influenced by a well-grounded comparison, which we
shall find occasion to confirm in a subsequent chapter;<a id="noteref_1211" name="noteref_1211" href="#note_1211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1211</span></span></a>
yet, in all probability, it was not the sun, but
Ormuzd, whom they supposed to be Apollo. It was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not until the philosophers of the Ionic school identified
the deities of the popular creed partly with material
powers and objects, and partly with the attributes of
the universal intellect (νοῦς), that the doctrine was
advanced of Apollo being the sun. From them Euripides,
who called Zeus the air, and Vesta the earth,
was naturally among the first to receive it. In the
tragedy of Phaethon, the mother of the unfortunate
youth complained against his father Helius as follows;
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rightly does he who knows the secret names of
the gods call thee Apollo</span></span>”</span> (the destroyer);<a id="noteref_1212" name="noteref_1212" href="#note_1212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1212</span></span></a> referring,
without doubt, not to any doctrine connected
with, or revealed in the mysteries, but to a philosophical
interpretation. This opinion, thus adopted by
Euripides, became still more general at Alexandria;
and Callimachus blames those <span class="tei tei-q">“who separate Apollo
from the sun, and Artemis from the moon.”</span><a id="noteref_1213" name="noteref_1213" href="#note_1213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1213</span></span></a> Soon
afterwards it was said to have originated in very early
times; and the author of the astronomical treatise
attributed to Eratosthenes<a id="noteref_1214" name="noteref_1214" href="#note_1214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1214</span></span></a> relates, that Orpheus the
Thracian had from the top of a mountain, at break of
day, prayed to the sun, whom he also called Apollo, as
the greatest of all the deities.<a id="noteref_1215" name="noteref_1215" href="#note_1215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1215</span></span></a> Nevertheless, this
statement does not authorize us to infer, that in the
ancient Orphic Hymns, previous to Herodotus, Apollo
and the sun were identified. For this system of religious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
speculation was chiefly concerned about Bacchus;
and in all the Orphic fragments of any antiquity
Apollo is hardly ever noticed.<a id="noteref_1216" name="noteref_1216" href="#note_1216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1216</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. It seems, therefore, that whatever might have
been the poetical attributes of Apollo in late times, in
his religious character he was never an elementary
deity, the essence of whose godhead is a personification
of the creative powers of nature. None of the
characteristic marks of such a religion are discoverable
in his worship. So far from being a god of generation<a id="noteref_1217" name="noteref_1217" href="#note_1217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1217</span></span></a>
and production, he remains unmarried and youthful;
for it is easy to see that his poetical amour with
the nymph Daphne, and his sons, mentioned in poetry
and prophecy, have no connexion with his worship.
In his sacred rites and symbols there is no trace of the
adoration of the generative powers, like those occurring
in the ancient Arcadian worship of Hermes, the
Argive fables of Here, or the Attic legends of Hephæstus
and Athene. The worship of Apollo is even
still more widely removed from the boisterous and
frantic orgies so conspicuous in the Thracian rites of
Dionysus. And although this latter worship flourished
by the side of Helicon and Parnassus, near the
Pythian temple, and both kinds of religious worship
were practised in the immediate neighbourhood of each
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

the services of the two gods always remained
dissimilar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the subsequent discussion we shall accordingly
take for granted the original diversity of Apollo and
the sun; and though the rites of the worship of
Apollo, as preserved and recorded in later times, are
doubtless of greater antiquity than any written documents
which either we or the Greeks possessed, it will
be convenient first to state the clearer and more intelligible
accounts of Homer on the subject of Apollo,
his divine character and worship.

1. Homer, as we have already seen, had, both from
hearsay and personal observation, acquired a very accurate
knowledge of the Cretan worship of Apollo in
the Smintheum, in the citadel of Troy, in Lycia near
mounts Ida and Cragus, as well as of Pytho and the
Delian palm-tree. His picture of Apollo is, however,
considerably changed by the circumstance of the god
acting as a friend to the Trojans and an enemy to the
Greeks, although both equally honour him with sacrifices
and pæans. Yet he generally appears to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Greeks in a darker and more unfavourable view.
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dread the son of Zeus</span></span>,”</span> says the priest of Chryse
to the Greeks, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he walks dark as night; the sure
and deadly arrows rattle on his shoulders</span></span>.”</span> His
punishments are sudden sickness, rapid pestilence, and
death, the cause and occasion of which is generally
unseen; yet sometimes he grants death as a blessing.<a id="noteref_1219" name="noteref_1219" href="#note_1219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1219</span></span></a>
His arrows are said to wound from afar, because they
are unforeseen and unexpected. He is called the far-darting
god;<a id="noteref_1220" name="noteref_1220" href="#note_1220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1220</span></span></a> his divine vengeance never misses its
aim. He appears in the terror of his might when
from the heights of the citadel he stimulates the Trojans
with a loud war-cry to the combat;<a id="noteref_1221" name="noteref_1221" href="#note_1221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1221</span></span></a> and leads
them on, a cloud around his shoulders, and the ægis in
his hand, into the thick of the battle,<a id="noteref_1222" name="noteref_1222" href="#note_1222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1222</span></span></a> like Ares himself,<a id="noteref_1223" name="noteref_1223" href="#note_1223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1223</span></span></a>
though far from showing the boisterous confidence
of that deity. Achilles, to whom he is indeed
particularly hostile, calls him the most pernicious of
all the gods. Even when he appears amongst the
gods, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all tremble before him in the palace of Zeus,

the character of Apollo. He is never represented
as hurried on by blind fury. He never opposes
the Greeks without reason, or through caprice, but
only when they disregard the sacred rights of priests
and suppliants, or assume an unusual degree of arrogance.
But when the gods separate into two bodies,
and descend to the contest, he, unmoved by passion,
shuns the combat, and speaks of the quick succession
of the race of man in a manner which betokens the
oracular deity of Pytho.<a id="noteref_1226" name="noteref_1226" href="#note_1226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1226</span></span></a> A similar spirit is perceivable

2. We will now examine the notions of other poets
on the character of Apollo as a revenging and punishing
deity, in which light he is introduced by Homer.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Archilochus calls upon Apollo to <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">punish and destroy
the guilty as he is wont to destroy them</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_1230" name="noteref_1230" href="#note_1230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1230</span></span></a> Hipponax,

to the name, says, Ἀπόλλων ἀπώλεσας;<a id="noteref_1232" name="noteref_1232" href="#note_1232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1232</span></span></a> which, however,
can hardly entitle us to infer that the name of
Apollo was really derived from ἀπολεῖν;<a id="noteref_1233" name="noteref_1233" href="#note_1233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1233</span></span></a> for we should
lose sight of one main point, viz., the object against
which his destructive powers were directed, or be reduced
to consider him an universal destroyer, a character
which is ill adapted to mark the nature of a divine
being of any kind whatsoever. Apollo slays, indeed,
but only to inflict deserved punishment. At Megara
was exhibited the tomb of Corœbus, who had slain the
Fury sent by Apollo against that town, to punish the
crimes of the fathers by destroying their children.<a id="noteref_1234" name="noteref_1234" href="#note_1234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1234</span></span></a>
After this action, Corœbus was ordered to carry in his
arms a tripod from Pytho, and erect on the spot where
he should fall down from exhaustion, a town (Tripodiscus)
and a temple to the god. This explains why many
sacred fines were at Corinth, Patara, and Amphipolis,<a id="noteref_1235" name="noteref_1235" href="#note_1235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1235</span></span></a>
paid into the temple of Apollo, who thus
appears, in some measure, as enforcing his own judgments.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Æschylus refers to his office of avenging
murder, where he speaks of Apollo, Pan, and Zeus,
as the gods who send the Furies;<a id="noteref_1236" name="noteref_1236" href="#note_1236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1236</span></span></a> Zeus as ruler of
the world, Pan as the dæmon that disorders the intellect,
Apollo as the god of punishment. Hence it
was not without reason that the Romans believed
Apollo to be represented in a statue of the god Vejovis,
a terrible god, equipped with arrows.<a id="noteref_1237" name="noteref_1237" href="#note_1237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1237</span></span></a> At least
there is some connexion between him and Apollo καταιβάσιος,
<span class="tei tei-q">“who darts down in the lightning;”</span> to whom
the Thessalians vowed every year a hecatomb of men.<a id="noteref_1238" name="noteref_1238" href="#note_1238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1238</span></span></a> At Argos it was the custom immediately after death
for the relations to sacrifice to Apollo as a god of
death; the priest of Apollo (the amphipolus) offered
up the victim, and for consuming the fragments of the
sacrifice a new fire was always kindled. On the
thirtieth day afterwards a sacrifice was offered to
Hermes as the conductor of souls.<a id="noteref_1239" name="noteref_1239" href="#note_1239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1239</span></span></a>

3. Although we have thus dwelt upon the gloomy
side of Apollo's character, it must not be supposed
that he was considered in the light of a malevolent and
destroying power. Thus Pindar declares that of all
the gods <span class="tei tei-q">“he is the most friendly to men.”</span><a id="noteref_1240" name="noteref_1240" href="#note_1240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1240</span></span></a> His
titles, also, as connected with different temples, serve
to remove that impression. Thus he was called the
Healer at Elis,<a id="noteref_1241" name="noteref_1241" href="#note_1241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1241</span></span></a> the Assister at Phigaleia,<a id="noteref_1242" name="noteref_1242" href="#note_1242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1242</span></span></a> the Defender,

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
oracles.<a id="noteref_1244" name="noteref_1244" href="#note_1244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1244</span></span></a> Although some of these names were perhaps
not introduced until the Peloponnesian war, and
the restriction of his avenging power to physical evil
is first perceptible in Pindar and the tragedians,<a id="noteref_1245" name="noteref_1245" href="#note_1245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1245</span></span></a> yet
the idea of the healing and protecting power of Apollo
must have been of remote antiquity. Under all these
names Apollo does not so much appear bestowing
positive good as assuaging and warding off evil; and in
this character he was invoked (according to an oracle)
to send health and good fortune.<a id="noteref_1246" name="noteref_1246" href="#note_1246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1246</span></span></a>

4. The preceding arguments may perhaps receive
confirmation from a description of the god <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Pæan</span></span>
(Παιήων) in Homer. The name clearly betokens a
healing deity, and though the poet indeed speaks of
him as a separate individual, and the physician of

poetical, without any reference to actual worship; since
from very early times the pæan had, in the Pythian
temple,<a id="noteref_1248" name="noteref_1248" href="#note_1248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1248</span></span></a> been appointed to be sung in honour of

Apollo.<a id="noteref_1249" name="noteref_1249" href="#note_1249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1249</span></span></a> The song, like other hymns, derived its
name from that of the god to whom it was sung.
The god was first called pæan, then the hymn, and
lastly the singers themselves.<a id="noteref_1250" name="noteref_1250" href="#note_1250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1250</span></span></a> Now we know that
the pæan was originally sung at the cessation of a plague,
and after a victory, and generally, when any evil was
averted, it was performed as a purification from the
pollution.<a id="noteref_1251" name="noteref_1251" href="#note_1251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1251</span></span></a> The chant was loud and joyous, as celebrating

Besides the pæans of victory,<a id="noteref_1253" name="noteref_1253" href="#note_1253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1253</span></span></a> however, there were
others which were sung at the beginning of battle;<a id="noteref_1254" name="noteref_1254" href="#note_1254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1254</span></span></a>
and there was a tradition that the chorus of Delphian
virgins had chanted <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Io Pæan</span></span>”</span> at the contest of
Apollo with the Python.<a id="noteref_1255" name="noteref_1255" href="#note_1255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1255</span></span></a> The pæan of victory varied
according to the different tribes; all Dorians, viz.,
Spartans, Argives, Corinthians, and Syracusans, had
the same.<a id="noteref_1256" name="noteref_1256" href="#note_1256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1256</span></span></a>
This use of the pæan, as a song of rejoicing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for victory, sufficiently explains its double meaning;
it bore a mournful sense in reference to the
battle, and a joyous sense in reference to the victory.
Apollo, under this name, was therefore either considered
as a destroying (from παίω), or as a protecting
and healing deity, who frees the mind from care and
sorrow;<a id="noteref_1257" name="noteref_1257" href="#note_1257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1257</span></span></a> and accordingly the tragedians, by an
analogical application of the word, also called Death, to
whom both these attributes belonged, by the title of
Pæan.<a id="noteref_1258" name="noteref_1258" href="#note_1258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1258</span></span></a> And thus this double character of Apollo,
by virtue of which he was equally formidable as a foe,
and welcome as an ally,<a id="noteref_1259" name="noteref_1259" href="#note_1259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1259</span></span></a> was authorized by the
ambiguity of his name.

5. On the other hand, the title <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Agyieus</span></span> had a
single signification.<a id="noteref_1260" name="noteref_1260" href="#note_1260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1260</span></span></a> This appellation of

antiquity at Delphi;<a id="noteref_1262" name="noteref_1262" href="#note_1262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1262</span></span></a> from which place,
however, it was brought over to Athens at a very early period,

statue was erected in court-yards, and before the doors
of houses; that is, at the boundary of private and public
property, in order to admit the god as a tutelary deity,
and to avert evil. The symbol or image of the god
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was most simple, being a conical block of stone. The
ancients knew not whether to consider it as an altar or
statue.<a id="noteref_1264" name="noteref_1264" href="#note_1264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1264</span></span></a> The worship consisted of a constant succession
of trifling services and marks of adoration.<a id="noteref_1265" name="noteref_1265" href="#note_1265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1265</span></span></a>
Frankincense was burnt before the pillar;<a id="noteref_1266" name="noteref_1266" href="#note_1266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1266</span></span></a> it was bedecked
with wreaths of myrtle, garlands, &amp;c. This
was sufficient to remind, and at the same time to assure,
the ancient Dorians of the protecting presence of their
deity. The Athenians represented their Hermes in a
similar manner. This god, although fundamentally
distinct from Apollo, was invested by them with the
same offices: thus the statues of both gods were placed,
as protecting powers, in front of the houses: both gods
were supposed to confer blessings on those who either
entered or left the house: both were represented by
simple columnar statues. With Apollo, however, this
protection was rather of a spiritual and inward nature:
while the phallic form, which always distinguished the
Hermæ of Athens, shows that this god was considered
to afford, by increasing the fruitfulness of the fields
and cattle, and generally all the products of nature, a
more external and physical assistance.

6. To these titles may perhaps be added the name
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Apollo</span></span> itself. That we must search for its etymology
in the Greek language alone, and that it could
have been derived from no other source, is evident
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the preceding investigations. In the first place,
then, we cannot derive it from the sun, ΑϜΕΛΙΟΣ,<a id="noteref_1267" name="noteref_1267" href="#note_1267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1267</span></span></a>
since the digamma is never changed into Π. The
derivation from ΟΛΩ we have already rejected, as
being founded on a partial and occasional attribute of
the god.<a id="noteref_1268" name="noteref_1268" href="#note_1268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1268</span></span></a> On the other hand, we may observe that
the ancient Doric Æolian form of the name was not
Ἀπόλλων but Ἀπέλλων,<a id="noteref_1269" name="noteref_1269" href="#note_1269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1269</span></span></a> which also obtained

and Delphian month <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">Apellæus</span></span> evidently derived its
name. Now if this is admitted to be the original
form, Ἀπέλλων simply means the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">averter</span></em> or
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">defender</span></em>,<a id="noteref_1271" name="noteref_1271" href="#note_1271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1271</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phœbus</span></span> expresses more nearly his peculiar nature.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is connected with the Latin <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">februare</span></span>), <span class="tei tei-q">“to

8. We now come to the most enigmatical of all
the titles of Apollo, viz., <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lyceus</span></span>.”</span> It was shown
above, that Apollo Lycius was worshipped at Lycorea
on mount Parnassus, in Lycia at the foot of mount
Cragus, in Lycia under mount Ida, at Athens, Argos,
Sparta, and Sicyon. This religion must have been
of greater antiquity than the Greek colonies in Asia
Minor, having been carried over thither at the time of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their establishment. Homer was also acquainted with
this title of Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In explanation of this epithet we every where find
traditions concerning wolves. The descendants of
Deucalion, who survived the deluge, following a
wolf's roar, founded Lycorea on a ridge of mount
Parnassus. Latona came as a she-wolf from the Hyperboreans
to Delos: she was conducted by wolves to
the river Xanthus. Wolves protected the treasures
of Apollo; and near the great altar at Delphi there
stood an iron wolf with ancient inscriptions.<a id="noteref_1280" name="noteref_1280" href="#note_1280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1280</span></span></a> The
attack of a wolf upon a herd of cattle occasioned the
worship of Apollo Lyceus at Argos, where a brazen
group of figures, commemorating the circumstance,
was erected in the market-place.<a id="noteref_1281" name="noteref_1281" href="#note_1281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1281</span></span></a> The Sicyonian
tradition of Apollo <span class="tei tei-q">“the destroyer of wolves”</span> is certainly
of less antiquity, as also the epithet Λυκοκτόνος
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lupercus</span></span>), which occurs in Sophocles and other
authors.<a id="noteref_1282" name="noteref_1282" href="#note_1282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1282</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now in inquiring into the meaning of the symbol
of the wolf in this signification, it may be first remarked
that it is a beast of prey. In this point of
view it cannot but appear a remarkable coincidence
that Apollo should in the Iliad assume the form of a
hawk,<a id="noteref_1283" name="noteref_1283" href="#note_1283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1283</span></span></a> and a species of falcon should be called his
swift messenger.<a id="noteref_1284" name="noteref_1284" href="#note_1284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1284</span></span></a> Thus also the tragedians frequently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
represented Apollo, in his character of a destroyer,
under the title of Lyceus.<a id="noteref_1285" name="noteref_1285" href="#note_1285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1285</span></span></a> We are not, however, to
suppose that it was this character of Apollo as a destroying
power which gave a name, not only to innumerable
temples, but even to whole countries; such a
supposition would, contrary to history and analogy,
make the early state of this religion to have been one
of the grossest barbarism and superstition. It is far
more probable that the name Lyceus is connected with
the ancient primitive word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lux</span></span> (whence λευκός).
The Greek word λύκη is preserved most distinctly in
λυκάβας, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">course
of the light</span></span>;<a id="noteref_1286" name="noteref_1286" href="#note_1286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1286</span></span></a> and by the epithet
Λυκηγένης, applied to Apollo by Homer,<a id="noteref_1287" name="noteref_1287" href="#note_1287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1287</span></span></a>
and probably taken from some ancient hymns, we should
(from the idiom of the Greek language) rather understand
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one born of light</span></em>, than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Lycian god</span></em>.
That light and splendour are frequently employed,
both in the symbols of worship and language of the
poets, to express the attributes of Apollo, cannot be
denied;<a id="noteref_1288" name="noteref_1288" href="#note_1288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1288</span></span></a> and we only remind the reader of the belief
that the fire which burnt on the altar of Apollo Lyceus
at Argos had originally fallen from heaven:<a id="noteref_1289" name="noteref_1289" href="#note_1289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1289</span></span></a>
and thus the epithet Lyceus would seem to belong
to the same class as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ægletes</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phœbus</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Xanthus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1290" name="noteref_1290" href="#note_1290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1290</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not to be supposed that the wolf was made use
of as a symbol of Apollo merely from an accidental
similarity of name; but it is difficult to discover
what analogy even the lively imagination of the
Greeks could have found between the wolf and
light. At a later period it was attempted to explain
this symbol by the circumstance that all wolves produced
their young within twelve days in the year, the
precise time during which Latona was wandering as
a she-wolf from the Hyperboreans to Delos.<a id="noteref_1291" name="noteref_1291" href="#note_1291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1291</span></span></a> This
physical interpretation was, however, grounded on the
fable, and not the fable on it. Perhaps the sharp
sight of the wolf<a id="noteref_1292" name="noteref_1292" href="#note_1292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1292</span></span></a> (if we can trust the accounts of
the ancients), or even the bright colour of the animal,
may afford a better explanation.<a id="noteref_1293" name="noteref_1293" href="#note_1293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1293</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the ancient Grecian worship, however, there is
another example, and one in the highest degree remarkable,
of the connexion between light and the
wolf. On the lofty peak of Lycæum, a mountain of
Arcadia, above the ancient Lycosura, there stood (as
Pindar says) a lofty and splendid altar of Zeus Lycæus,
with which were in some way connected all the
traditions concerning Lycaon, who sacrificed his child
to Zeus, and was in consequence transformed into a
wolf. Now not only does the symbol of the wolf
occur in this place,<a id="noteref_1294" name="noteref_1294" href="#note_1294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1294</span></span></a> but there is also a
reference to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
light. There stood here a sacred shrine or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">adytum</span></span>,
supposed to be inaccessible; and the popular belief
was, that whoever entered it cast no shadow; and in
order to escape being sacrificed, the aggressor was
obliged to escape as a deer: hence the pursuing god
naturally appeared to the imagination as a wolf.<a id="noteref_1295" name="noteref_1295" href="#note_1295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1295</span></span></a>
We perceive that light was supposed to dwell within
the sanctuary. Thus in this very ancient worship of
the Parrhasians, which in other respects has little in
common with the Doric worship of Apollo, we discover
the same combination of ideas and symbols that
exists in the latter, and cannot but consider it a vestige
of some very ancient symbolical idea peculiar and
general among the Greeks.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Having proceeded so far, we shall endeavour to
unite and harmonize the different facts already collected.
Apollo, as he is represented by Homer, exhibits
the character of a destroying and avenging, as
well as a delivering and protecting power. But he
is the avenger of impiety and arrogance, and the
punisher of injustice and sin, and not the author of
evil to mankind for evil's sake. He was therefore
always considered as attended with certain beings
whose nature was contrary to his own; his character
could only be shown in opposition with a system of
hostile attributes and powers. As the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">warring</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">victorious</span></em> god, he required enemies to combat and
conquer: as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bright</span></em> god, he implies the
existence of a dark and impure side of nature. In
this manner the worship of Apollo resembled those
religions, such as the ancient Persian, which were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
founded on the doctrine of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two principles</span></em>, one of good,
the other of evil. At the same time he is no deified
personification of the creative or generative powers of
nature, nor of any natural object or phenomenon;
and he has therefore nothing in common with the
deities of the elementary religions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These ideas, which seem to be expressed with
tolerable distinctness, in the most ancient epithets and
symbols connected with the worship of Apollo, as
well as in the images and fictions of poets down to
the time of Euripides, we will first examine with
reference to the mythical history and adventures of
Apollo, and secondly we will endeavour to point out
the influence which these notions exercised upon the
worship itself.

1. Our present investigation renders it necessary
to ascend to a period in which the primitive religion of
the Dorians exhibited a distinct and original character,
before it had been combined with the worship of other
deities. At that time this nation had only two male
deities, Zeus and Apollo: for the existence of the latter
everywhere supposes that of the former, and both
were intimately connected in Crete, Delphi, and elsewhere;
though the Doric Zeus did not receive great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
religious honours. In the temple of Delphi, Zeus and
Apollo were represented as Moiragetæ, accompanied
by two Fates.<a id="noteref_1296" name="noteref_1296" href="#note_1296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1296</span></span></a> The supreme deity, however, when
connected with Apollo, was neither born, nor visible
on earth, and perhaps never considered as having any
immediate influence upon men. But Apollo, who is
often emphatically called the son of Zeus,<a id="noteref_1297" name="noteref_1297" href="#note_1297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1297</span></span></a> acts as his
intercessor, ambassador, and prophet with mankind.<a id="noteref_1298" name="noteref_1298" href="#note_1298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1298</span></span></a>
And whilst the father of the gods appears, indistinctly
and at a distance, dwelling in ether, and enthroned in
the highest heavens, Apollo is described as a divine
hero, whose office is to ward off evils and dangers,
establish rights of expiation, and announce the ordinances
of Fate. It is our purpose to investigate these
latter attributes, more especially in the mythology of
Delos and Delphi.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The legend of the birth of Apollo at Delos was
indeed recognised by the Ionians and Athenians, but
neither by the Delphians, Bœotians, nor Peloponnesians;<a id="noteref_1299" name="noteref_1299" href="#note_1299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1299</span></span></a>
as is plain from the indifference which they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
generally showed for the temple in that island. We
also know that the Bœotians represented Tegyra as
the birthplace of Apollo.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Apollo, says Pindar, was born with time;<a id="noteref_1300" name="noteref_1300" href="#note_1300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1300</span></span></a>—alluding
to the many obstacles and delays experienced at his
birth. These had been occasioned by the influence of
an hostile power, the same which produced Typhaon
from the depths of Tartarus,<a id="noteref_1301" name="noteref_1301" href="#note_1301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1301</span></span></a> called by the poets Here.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This power refused its assistance at the birth of
Apollo, and compelled Latona to wander in the pains
of childbirth over earth and sea until she arrived at the
rocky island of Delos.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Hence the island of Delos itself became one of
the subjects of mythology. Pindar, in an ode to
Delos, addresses it as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the daughter of the sea, the
unshaken prodigy of the earth, which mortals call
Delos, but the gods in Olympus the far-famed
star of the dark earth</span></span>;”</span><a id="noteref_1302" name="noteref_1302" href="#note_1302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1302</span></span></a> and related how <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
island, driven about by the winds and waves, as
soon as Latona had placed her foot on its shore,
became fast bound to the roots of the earth by four
columns</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_1303" name="noteref_1303" href="#note_1303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1303</span></span></a>
The fable of the floating island<a id="noteref_1304" name="noteref_1304" href="#note_1304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1304</span></span></a> (which
is, however, of a more recent date than the Homeric
hymn to Apollo) indicated merely the restless condition
which preceded the tranquillity and brightness introduced
by the manifestation of the god. Henceforth
Delos remained fixed and unshaken, immoveable, according
to the belief of the Greeks, even by earthquakes;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for which reason, the whole of Greece was
alarmed when this phenomenon happened before the
Persian war.<a id="noteref_1305" name="noteref_1305" href="#note_1305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1305</span></span></a> By the words <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the star of the dark
earth</span></span>,”</span> Pindar alludes to the idea that Delos (as the
name shows) was considered as a pure and bright
island, whose shores, too holy for pollution, were ever
kept free from corpses, the sight of which is odious to
the god. Hence also the tradition that Asteria, whose
name is derived from ἀστὴρ, the offspring of the Titans,
had cast herself into the sea, and been petrified on the
shore.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The birth of Apollo, being an epoch in mythology,
was without doubt celebrated in ancient
hymns, whose simplicity presented a striking contrast
to the higher polish of the Homeric poems. A hymn
of this description, ascribed to Olen, was addressed to
Eileithyia, the worship of which goddess, together with
other religious ceremonies, was brought over (as has
been above remarked)<a id="noteref_1306" name="noteref_1306" href="#note_1306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1306</span></span></a>
from Cnosus to Delos, and
from thence to Athens.<a id="noteref_1307" name="noteref_1307" href="#note_1307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1307</span></span></a> In calling Eileithyia the
mother of the god of love,<a id="noteref_1308" name="noteref_1308" href="#note_1308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1308</span></span></a> Olen exceeded the
regular bounds of tradition respecting Apollo, by confusing the
worship of a strange god with that deity, and probably
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
identified her with the ancient Aphrodite (Ἀφροδίτη
ἀρχαία), whose altar Theseus is said to have erected
at Delos.<a id="noteref_1309" name="noteref_1309" href="#note_1309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1309</span></span></a> In either case, the establishment of this
ancient Attic worship on the sacred island, and its
connexion with the Delian rites, illustrate the mention
of Eros in the Delian hymn.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nine days and nine nights Latona writhed in
hopeless pains of childbirth, surrounded by the benevolent
Titanidæ, Dione, Rhea, Themis, and Amphitrite,
who finally</span></span> (according to the hymn of
Homer) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prevailed upon Eileithyia by the promise of
a golden necklace. Then the pains seized Latona;
she cast her arms around the palm-tree, and brought
forth her divine son.</span></span> The explanations of the bribe
offered to Eileithyia are all too far-fetched: probably
pregnant women at Delos consecrated their necklaces
to that goddess.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The exact spot where the birth of Apollo took
place was shown in Delos, since the least circumstance
connected with so important an event could not fail to
excite interest. It must be looked for in the place
where the torrent Inopus flows from mount Cynthus.<a id="noteref_1310" name="noteref_1310" href="#note_1310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1310</span></span></a>
Here there was a circular pool (the λίμνη τροχόεσσα),
the form of which is often carefully mentioned.<a id="noteref_1311" name="noteref_1311" href="#note_1311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1311</span></span></a> By
its side grew two sacred trees, the palm and the olive,
which are not elsewhere reckoned among those sacred
to Apollo; as in Greece Proper the first does not grow
at all, and the second not without great care. The
Delian temple alone could boast of the palm, the use
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of palm-branches at the games having also originated
in Delos.<a id="noteref_1312" name="noteref_1312" href="#note_1312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1312</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This island acquired so much sanctity by the birth
of Apollo, that no living being was permitted either to
be born or die within its boundary.<a id="noteref_1313" name="noteref_1313" href="#note_1313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1313</span></span></a> Every
pregnant woman was obliged to go over to the neighbouring
island of Rheneia, in order to be delivered. One of
the ideas of the Greeks respecting religious purity
(which may in general be traced to the worship of
Apollo) was, that all intercourse with pregnant women
polluted in the same manner as the touch of a corpse.
The prohibition against keeping dogs had the same
origin.<a id="noteref_1314" name="noteref_1314" href="#note_1314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1314</span></span></a> On the whole, the Delian traditions are not
to be considered as of very great antiquity or credit;
they contain, indeed, hardly any original source of information
respecting Apollo, being generally composed
of descriptions of the sanctity of the island itself;
several legends, as that of its having once floated on
the ocean, &amp;c., appear to have been the invention of
the Ionians; this race, even in fiction, allowing itself
far greater latitude than the Dorians.

6. Apollo, according to the Attic legend, passed to
Delphi from Delos through Attica and Bœotia; the
Homeric Hymn to Apollo makes him come from the
northern districts, but likewise through Bœotia: according
to other traditions he came from the Hyperboreans.
According to another, Latona was carrying
the two babes, Apollo and Artemis, in her arms, when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
assailed by the Python,<a id="noteref_1315" name="noteref_1315" href="#note_1315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1315</span></span></a> the mother seeking refuge on

another, Apollo was a child at the time of this event;<a id="noteref_1317" name="noteref_1317" href="#note_1317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1317</span></span></a>
and, accordingly, a Delphian boy, both whose parents
were alive, represented the actions of the deity at the
great festival. The destruction of the Python, however,
always formed the chief event of the sacred fable.
It was by this feat that Apollo gained possession of the
oracular chasm, from which the goddess Earth had
once spoken. It was not, however, without some resistance
that she gave way to the claims of the youthful
god, whom, according to Pindar, she even attempted
to hurl down to Tartarus.<a id="noteref_1318" name="noteref_1318" href="#note_1318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1318</span></span></a> The serpent Python

sprung from the warm clay that remained after the general deluge,
and dwelling in a dark defile near a fountain, which
was said to be supplied from the Styx.<a id="noteref_1320" name="noteref_1320" href="#note_1320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1320</span></span></a> The serpent,
as usual, represents an earthly being, by which is personified
the rough and shapeless offspring of nature.
It was supposed to be connected with the nature of
water and the sea; and hence was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Delphin</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

particularly sacred to Apollo, and in all probability
was also conceived to have been subdued by him.
After this, the serpent that watched the oracle remained,
although conquered, as a memorial of the
ancient struggle, and of the victory of the god, and was
placed near the rocky chasm at the foot of the tripod,
in the inner sanctuary.<a id="noteref_1322" name="noteref_1322" href="#note_1322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1322</span></span></a>

7. The battle with the Python being finished,<a id="noteref_1323" name="noteref_1323" href="#note_1323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1323</span></span></a>

victory.<a id="noteref_1324" name="noteref_1324" href="#note_1324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1324</span></span></a> Here too he was said first to have sung the
pæan, as a strain of triumph. In the dramatic exhibition,
by which the Delphians represented the adventures
of Apollo, the Pythian strain (νόμος Πύθιος)
was here introduced. This air, which was originally
nothing more than a simple melody, soon received
all the embellishment of art; and, being raised by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Timosthenes to the dignity of a great musical composition,<a id="noteref_1325" name="noteref_1325" href="#note_1325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1325</span></span></a>
was (contrary to the ancient custom) performed
with flutes, lyres, and trumpets, without the accompaniment
of the voice. The accounts concerning this
festival are indeed copious, but unluckily of too late a
date to give us an idea of its ancient and genuine
character. In Plutarch's time<a id="noteref_1326" name="noteref_1326" href="#note_1326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1326</span></span></a> it was not a hollow
serpent's den, but an imitation of a princely house
(καλιὰς), that was erected in a court (ἅλως), at every
octennial festival.<a id="noteref_1327" name="noteref_1327" href="#note_1327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1327</span></span></a> Into this building the women of a

(δολωνεία) with lighted torches, and fled away through
the door, overturning the table, and setting fire to the
house.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Although the destruction of the Python is
characterized as a triumph of the higher and divine
power of the deity, yet the victorious god was considered
as polluted by the blood of the monster, and
obliged to undergo a series of afflictions and woes.
Tradition represented him as going immediately after
the battle by the sacred road to Tempe; which the boy,
who personified Apollo, afterwards took as leader of
the religious procession.<a id="noteref_1329" name="noteref_1329" href="#note_1329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1329</span></span></a> The direction of this road
has been accurately stated above. The chief circumstance
in this wandering was the bondage θήτευσις
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Apollo under Admetus the Pheræan, to which the
god subjected himself in order to expiate his guilt.
This too was represented by the boy, who probably
imitated the manner in which the god, as a herdsman
and slave, submitted to the most degrading services.<a id="noteref_1330" name="noteref_1330" href="#note_1330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1330</span></span></a>
Perhaps it was the piety of Admetus, celebrated in
tradition, which entitled him to the privilege of possessing
such a slave; yet it must be doubted, whether,
conformably to the spirit of the ancient mythology, an
ideal being, and not a mortal hero, was not originally
intended to be represented under this name. Ἄδμητος
is an usual name for the god of the infernal regions;
to whom, according to the original idea, Apollo became
enslaved. The worship of this deity is connected with
that of Hecate, who was called θεὰ Φεραία, and the
daughter of Admetus.<a id="noteref_1331" name="noteref_1331" href="#note_1331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1331</span></span></a> Cannot we, in the

Hercules, find some clue which may lead us to suppose
that the fable of Admetus refers to a worship of the
infernal deities? An ancient dirge, called the song
of Admetus, was chanted in Greece, having, as was
pretended, been first sung by Admetus at the death of
his wife, originally perhaps addressed to Αἵδες
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

the religious poetry in question, that the god, who had
been polluted by the combat with the impure being,
should be obliged, in order to complete his penance, to
descend into the infernal regions. In confirmation of
this, there have been preserved some obscure traditions,
which represent Apollo as actually dying, that is, descending
into the infernal regions.<a id="noteref_1334" name="noteref_1334" href="#note_1334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1334</span></span></a> However, after
eight years, the appointed time of bondage, the god
wanders to the ancient altar of Tempe, where, sprinkling
with laurel-branches, and other expiatory rites,
symbolically restore his purity,<a id="noteref_1335" name="noteref_1335" href="#note_1335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1335</span></span></a> After this, the

9. These Delphian traditions in very early times
became the theme of epic poetry, in which however
another cause was assigned for the slavery of Apollo;
it was represented as a punishment inflicted by Zeus
for slaying the Cyclops, who forged the lightning with
which Zeus struck his son Æsculapius, because, not
satisfied with recovering the sick, he even recalled the
dead to life.<a id="noteref_1336" name="noteref_1336" href="#note_1336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1336</span></span></a> Yet some of the poets also state that

the Delphian period. We may perhaps find a trace
of a more ancient tradition in the story of amber being
a petrified tear, which Apollo shed during the time of
his slavery in his ancient abode amongst the Hyperboreans,
in the land of the Celts.<a id="noteref_1338" name="noteref_1338" href="#note_1338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1338</span></span></a>

The combat with Tityus is nearly allied to that with
the Python. This earth-born monster, dwelling at
Panopea, a town situated on the sacred road, and hostile
to the Delphians, laid hands upon Latona when
passing through that place: but her children soon overcome
the ravisher, and send him to the shades below;
where a vulture incessantly preys upon his liver,<a id="noteref_1339" name="noteref_1339" href="#note_1339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1339</span></span></a> the

evident that, in the language of this religion, fate was
considered as the will of Zeus (Διὸς νοὸς, Διὸς αἴσα),
who was at Delphi called Μοιραγέτης, <span class="tei tei-q">“leader of
fate;”</span> whilst the epic poets, from their custom of
making each god a separate individual, generally
(though the glimmering of a more exalted idea may
be sometimes traced) made Zeus, like all other individuals,
subject to fate. The prophetic powers of
Apollo will be more fully treated of in the following
chapter.

1. Our intention in this chapter is to show that,
besides the mythology, the ceremonies also of the
worship of Apollo so agree and harmonize together,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as to furnish a decisive proof of its regular and systematic
development; after which we will endeavour to
point out this agreement, and elucidate its relative
bearings; although an attempt of this kind must
necessarily be very imperfect, since the religion,
which, in order to comprehend, we should regard with
the ardour of devotion, is now merely the subject of
cold and heartless speculation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, with regard to the sacrifices, it is remarkable,
that in many of the principal temples a particular
sanctity and importance was attributed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bloodless</span></em>
offerings. At Delphi cakes and frankincense were
consecrated in holy baskets;<a id="noteref_1341" name="noteref_1341" href="#note_1341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1341</span></span></a> at Patara, cakes in the
form of bows, arrows, and lyres, emblems both of the
wrath and placability of the deity.<a id="noteref_1342" name="noteref_1342" href="#note_1342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1342</span></span></a> At Delos, an
altar, called the altar of the pious, stood behind the
altar built of horns, on which were deposited only
cakes of wheat and barley; this, according to tradition,
was the only one on which Pythagoras sacrificed.<a id="noteref_1343" name="noteref_1343" href="#note_1343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1343</span></span></a>
In this island also at festivals were offered mallows
and ears of corn;<a id="noteref_1344" name="noteref_1344" href="#note_1344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1344</span></span></a> the simplest food of man, in remembrance
of primitive simplicity and temperance.
At Delphi the young women of Parnassus are said
to have brought the first-fruits of the year to Apollo,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
immediately after the destruction of the Python.<a id="noteref_1345" name="noteref_1345" href="#note_1345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1345</span></span></a>
The pious offerings of the Hyperboreans, as has been
remarked above, were the same as those last enumerated.
And perhaps we may add to our list the custom,
at the Attic autumnal festival of the Pyanepsia,
of hanging grapes, fruits, and small jars of honey and
oil, to branches of olive or laurel bound with wool,
and carrying them to the doors of a temple of Apollo;<a id="noteref_1346" name="noteref_1346" href="#note_1346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1346</span></span></a>
though perhaps this rite belonged rather to Bacchus,
the Sun, and the Hours,<a id="noteref_1347" name="noteref_1347" href="#note_1347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1347</span></span></a> who shared the honour of
this festival with Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The above offerings doubtless express the existence
of a pure and filial relation, like that in which
the Hyperboreans stood to Apollo; it being quite
sufficient for persons in so innocent a state to give a
constant acknowledgment of the benevolence and
power with which the god defends and preserves
them. But as the pure deity was himself supposed
to be stained with blood, so might the minds of his
worshippers become tainted with sin, and lose their
internal quiet. When in this state, being as it were
under the influence of a fiendlike and corrupting
power (Ἄτη), the mind naturally wishes to put an
end to its unhappy condition by some specific and
definite act. This is effected by the solemn expiation
and purification of the religion of Apollo. Expiatory
rites were thus introduced into the regular system of worship,
and formed a part of the ancient <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus sacrum.</span></span>
It was soon however perceived that the usual routine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of life sometimes needed the same ceremony, and
hence expiatory <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">festivals</span></em> were connected with the
public worship of the god; by which not only individuals,
but whole cities were purified. These festivals
were naturally celebrated in the spring, when the
storms of winter disappear, and nature bursts into
fresh life.<a id="noteref_1348" name="noteref_1348" href="#note_1348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1348</span></span></a> But in these the pious gifts of individuals
no longer sufficed, nor even the sacrifice of animals;
and the troubled mind seemed to require for its purification
a greater sacrifice. At Athens, during the
Thargelia, two men (or a man and a woman), adorned
with flowers and fruits, having been rubbed over with
fragrant herbs, were led in the most solemn manner,
like victims, before the gate, and thrown with imprecations
from the rock; but were in all probability
taken up below, and carried beyond the borders.
The persons used for these expiations (Φαρμακοὶ)
were condemned criminals, whom the city provided
for the purpose.<a id="noteref_1349" name="noteref_1349" href="#note_1349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1349</span></span></a> This festival was common to all
Ionians; it is particularly mentioned at Miletus<a id="noteref_1350" name="noteref_1350" href="#note_1350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1350</span></span></a> and
Paros;<a id="noteref_1351" name="noteref_1351" href="#note_1351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1351</span></span></a> and the same rites were also practised in the
Phocæan colony of Massalia.<a id="noteref_1352" name="noteref_1352" href="#note_1352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1352</span></span></a> In Ionia the victims
were beaten with branches of the fig-tree and with
sea-onions; at the same time there was played on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
flute a strain (called χραδίης), which, according to
the testimony of Hipponax, was reduced by Mimnermus
into elegiac measure.<a id="noteref_1353" name="noteref_1353" href="#note_1353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1353</span></span></a> At Athens also the victims
were crowned with figs and fig-branches, being
probably the symbol of utter worthlessness. The
antiquity of this manner of purification has been
shown above, in our remarks upon the religious ceremonies
of Leucadia.<a id="noteref_1354" name="noteref_1354" href="#note_1354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1354</span></span></a>

3. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peace-offerings</span></em> (ἱλασμοὶ), by which Apollo
was first appeased, and his wrath averted, should, as
it appears, be distinguished from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purifications</span></em>
(καθαρμοὶ), by which he was supposed to restore the
mind to purity and tranquillity. At Sicyon (where
the religion of Apollo flourished at a very early period)
it was related, that Apollo and Artemis had, after the
destruction of the Python, wished to be there purified,
but that, being driven away by a phantom (whence in
after-times a certain spot in the town was called
φόβος), they proceeded to some other place. Upon
this the inhabitants were attacked by a pestilence;
and the seers ordered them to appease the deities.
Seven boys and the same number of girls were ordered
to go to the river Sythas and bathe in its waters, then
to carry the statues of the two deities into the temple of Peitho,
and from thence back to that of Apollo.<a id="noteref_1355" name="noteref_1355" href="#note_1355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1355</span></span></a>
The Attic festival of Delphinia (on the sixth of Munychion)
had evidently the same meaning; in this
seven boys and girls reverently conveyed the ἱκετηρία,
an olive-branch bound with white fillets of wool, into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Delphinium.<a id="noteref_1356" name="noteref_1356" href="#note_1356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1356</span></span></a> This took place exactly one month
before the Thargelia; and in all probability the peace-offerings
and purifications (ἱλασμοὶ and καθαρμοὶ)
were celebrated at the same period throughout the
whole of Greece.

4. By comparing and arranging the scattered fragments

belonging to these two classes, we shall obtain
the following clear and simple account.<a id="noteref_1357" name="noteref_1357" href="#note_1357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1357</span></span></a>

In the commencement of the Apollinian year, in
the first month of spring, called Bysius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Πύθιος)
at Delphi, Munychion at Athens, Apollo was supposed
to come through the defile of Parnassus to Delphi,
and begin the battle with the Delphinè. He next
assumes the character of the wrathful god, whom it
was necessary to appease; and hence, on the sixth day
of the month, the expiatory festival of Delphinia took
place at Athens, and probably also at Miletus and
Massalia; we may likewise suppose that it was the
same month which in Ægina and Thera went under
the name of Delphinius:<a id="noteref_1358" name="noteref_1358" href="#note_1358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1358</span></span></a> on the seventh Apollo destroyed

This too was the day on which, according to immemorial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
custom, the oracle first broke silence; at a late
period it was also esteemed at Delphi as the birthday
of Apollo.<a id="noteref_1360" name="noteref_1360" href="#note_1360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1360</span></span></a> Immediately after, the Delphian procession
moved on to Tempe; and at the same time
the tithes of men were once despatched to Apollo in
Crete.<a id="noteref_1361" name="noteref_1361" href="#note_1361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1361</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the second month of spring, called by the Ionians
Thargelion, Apollo was purified at the altar at Tempe,
and probably on the seventh day of the month; for
the great expiatory festival of both deities, Apollo and
Artemis, was at Athens celebrated on the sixth and
seventh days; and Delos was at the same time purified;
this ceremony was immediately followed by a
feast of thanksgiving in honour of the god of light.
According to Delian tradition, Artemis and Apollo
(ἑβδομαγέτης)<a id="noteref_1362" name="noteref_1362" href="#note_1362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1362</span></span></a> were born on the sixth and seventh
days of this month.<a id="noteref_1363" name="noteref_1363" href="#note_1363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1363</span></span></a> On the same day however on
which the Delphian boy broke the laurel and turned
homewards, the purifying laurel-boughs (from which

the festival of the Daphnephoria derived its name)<a id="noteref_1364" name="noteref_1364" href="#note_1364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1364</span></span></a>

throughout the rest of Greece.<a id="noteref_1365" name="noteref_1365" href="#note_1365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1365</span></span></a> Soon after this, the
setting of the Pleiades took place (the day before the
ides of May, according to the statement of Eudoxus);<a id="noteref_1366" name="noteref_1366" href="#note_1366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1366</span></span></a>
at which time Hesiod makes the harvest begin; then,
as has been above remarked, on the testimony of Diodorus
and ancient works of art,<a id="noteref_1367" name="noteref_1367" href="#note_1367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1367</span></span></a> Apollo, having been
presented with the first ears of corn, leaves the Hyperboreans,
and appears in a milder and more noble character
at Delphi.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If it was wished that the setting of the Pleiades
should occur at a regular interval from the preceding
festival, this could have been effected only by cycles,
by which the lunar and sidereal years were made to
agree. Now it was not difficult to observe, that, after
ninety-nine lunar months, the setting of the Pleiades
coincided pretty exactly with the same phase of the
moon. From this circumstance arose the period of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eight years</span></em>, called by the Greeks ἐνναετηρὶς, in conformity
with which the great festivals of Apollo at
Delphi, Crete, and Thebes were from the earliest
times arranged.<a id="noteref_1368" name="noteref_1368" href="#note_1368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1368</span></span></a>

5. These data afford a sufficient proof of a remarkable
and by no means fortuitous connexion between
the expiatory festivals of Apollo: we may discover the
vestiges of a sacred calendar, once, without doubt,
preserved entire, but which, through the various combinations
introduced into the Grecian worship, became
disjointed and broken. This was particularly the case
in the Attic festivals, where the same festival is frequently,
as it were, doubled, and placed in different
portions of the year. A remarkable instance, illustrative
of the above remark, immediately occurs to
us. As the months Munychion and Thargelion succeeded
each other in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> half of the year, so
did Boëdromion and Pyanepsion in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>. The
sixth of Boëdromion was sacred to Artemis; the seventh,
without doubt, to Apollo Boëdromius, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
martial god</span></em>; who therefore corresponds with the
Delphinian Apollo, and the festival with the Delphinia.
The Pyanepsia, however, were very similar
to the Thargelia; the laurel-boughs wrapt with wool,
carried round at the celebration of both, remind us of
the Daphnephoria;<a id="noteref_1369" name="noteref_1369" href="#note_1369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1369</span></span></a> only, as was above remarked, the
worship of Bacchus, which Theseus is said to have
established at Naxos, after his return from the islands,
was mixed up with it, and is to be recognised in the
carrying of boughs (ὀσχοφορία), which was introduced
into this festival. Thus these four seventh
days (ἑβδόμαι) correspond with each other as follows:

6. We turn from these expiatory festivals of universal
occurrence to the expiations which the religion
of Apollo enjoined for those who had incurred the
guilt of homicide.<a id="noteref_1370" name="noteref_1370" href="#note_1370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1370</span></span></a> We previously noticed some
establishments of this nature connected with the temples
at Tænarum, at Trœzen, and of Branchidæ: a
similar one also existed at Delphi, as may be gathered
from the fable of Orestes, related by Æschylus, in
which Apollo appears at the same time as leader of
the avenging Furies, and as purifier of the murderer.
Immediately after this deed, the matricide takes an
olive-branch bound with woollen fillets,<a id="noteref_1371" name="noteref_1371" href="#note_1371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1371</span></span></a> and flies <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">like
a frightened stag</span></span><a id="noteref_1372" name="noteref_1372" href="#note_1372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1372</span></span></a> to Delphi, where Apollo himself
purifies his blood-stained hands by the sacrifice of
swine and ablutions;<a id="noteref_1373" name="noteref_1373" href="#note_1373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1373</span></span></a> and thus liberates him from the
Furies, as a defence against whom he had (according
to Stesichorus) also given him a bow and arrows.<a id="noteref_1374" name="noteref_1374" href="#note_1374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1374</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
After the purification of Orestes at Delphi, the Athenian
poets affirm that he went to Athens, and, under
the protection of the god, placed himself before the
Areopagus, where Cephalus had also stood in a similar
situation.<a id="noteref_1375" name="noteref_1375" href="#note_1375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1375</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At Athens likewise, as was remarked above, the
expiatory rites of the worship of Apollo were connected
with the criminal courts of justice, the aristocratic
ephetæ being intrusted both with the ceremony
of purification and the duties of judges. These were
fifty-one men, of noble birth,<a id="noteref_1376" name="noteref_1376" href="#note_1376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1376</span></span></a> who in early times had
jurisdiction in five courts of justice (amongst which
the Areopagus was of course included) over every description
of homicide.<a id="noteref_1377" name="noteref_1377" href="#note_1377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1377</span></span></a> Solon probably first separated
the Areopagus from the other four courts; and
in order to make it a timocratic tribunal, with cognizance
over cases of wilful murder, he gave it great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
political, though not religious power; the latter he
was not able to bestow. The jurisdiction of the
ephetæ was now confined to cases of unintentional
or justifiable homicide, and some others of no importance;
thus remaining a singular remnant of the
ancient judicial forms, in the midst of an universal
change. We shall now describe the ceremonies in
use at the expiation of homicides. It is necessary,
however, in the first place, to distinguish the wilful
murderer, who either left for ever his native land,
losing all privileges and property therein, or who
suffered the penalty of the laws, from the man who
killed another without design, or with some good
cause, to be approved by the sentence of the ephetæ.
A person in the latter situation left his country by a
particular road for a certain time; during which he
also kept at a distance from places of public resort
(ἀπενιαυτισμὸς).<a id="noteref_1378" name="noteref_1378" href="#note_1378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1378</span></span></a> Afterwards, the reconciliation took

kind was an unfortunate person, and therefore, according
to the opinion of the ancient Greeks, worthy of
respect. Afterwards, the perpetrator was purified
from all guilt by sacrifices and expiatory rites. In
early times the purification probably always took place
abroad, frequently in the ancient settlements of the
injured family. At Athens it was performed after
the return of the criminal; and there the cases of
atoneable murders were of course less frequent than
in the heroic age; since, under a less regular government,
and with closer family ties, there were more
incitements and excuses for that crime. Hence at
that time those institutions must have been of double
importance, which checked the fearful consequences
of an unlucky act, quieted the workings of an uneasy
conscience, and moderated the too eager thirst for
revenge.<a id="noteref_1381" name="noteref_1381" href="#note_1381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1381</span></span></a>

as the origin of the ancient symbolical language in
general. Perhaps it was merely the appearance of
the evergreen-tree, with its slender form and glittering
leaves, that made it a symbol of Apollo. The laurel
will bear a tolerably severe winter,<a id="noteref_1395" name="noteref_1395" href="#note_1395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1395</span></span></a> and therefore
nourished in the north of Greece; while the olive, the
tree of Athene, belongs to its more southern regions.
But, be this as it may, the situation of Tempe, where
this shrub still grows with great luxuriance, certainly
added much to the sanctity of the symbol:<a id="noteref_1396" name="noteref_1396" href="#note_1396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1396</span></span></a> and for this

be proper preparatives for entering the sanctuary.<a id="noteref_1398" name="noteref_1398" href="#note_1398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1398</span></span></a>

8. It has appeared incomprehensible to many, why
Apollo should be a god of prophecy, and how this office
can be reconciled with his other attributes. Many
have been satisfied with supposing an accidental association
of music, prophecy, and archery, without being
able to discover any principle of union. In the following
pages we shall endeavour to account for the combination
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the same deity of attributes apparently so
unconnected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Prophecy, according to the ideas of the ancients, is
the announcement of fate (of μοῖρα, αἶσα). Now fate
was considered to be the right order of things, the
established physical and moral harmony of the world,
in which every thing occupies the place fitted for its
capacities and function. Fate therefore coincides with
supreme Justice (Θέμις); which notion Hesiod expressed
by saying that Zeus married Themis, who
produced to him the Fates. The pious, religious
mind could not separate Zeus and Destiny: Fate was
the will and thought of the highest of the gods. A
man whose actions agreed with this established harmony,
and who followed the appointed course of
things, acted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justly</span></em> (κατ᾽ αἶσαν, ἐναίσιμα); the violent
and arrogant man endeavoured at least to break
through the laws of Fate. Now it was this right
order of events which the ancient oracles were supposed
to proclaim; and hence they were called θέμιστες,
ordinances or laws of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justice</span></em>.<a id="noteref_1399" name="noteref_1399" href="#note_1399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1399</span></span></a> They were not imagined
to be derived from a foreknowledge of futurity;
but merely to declare that which, according to the
necessary course of events, must come to pass. It
cannot indeed fail to surprise us that the oracle was
delivered by a woman in a state of ecstasy, and not as
the result of serious reflection. But do we not find in
the earlier period of Grecian philosophy (especially in
the Ionic school) every new and profound discovery
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appearing as the work of sudden illumination and
ecstasy, and indeed often accompanied with miraculous
circumstances? And would not the mind in that age
have naturally been raised to such an excited and
rapturous state, when, endeavouring to escape from
the narrow bounds of daily life, it recognised in the
general course of events the influence of the gods?
The means adopted to promote this inspiration, the
vapour of the chasm, the chewing of the laurel-leaves,
the drinking of the water of the well, are of the most
innocent description. We do not however mean to
deny that these ceremonies soon became an unmeaning
form, the oracle being made subservient to political
purposes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The custom of a woman giving utterance to the
decrees of the god originated partly from the peculiar
estimation in which women were held by the Dorians,
and partly from the natural tendency of the female sex
(so often remarked by the ancients) to fits of ecstasy.
Prophetesses were elsewhere also frequently connected
with temples of Apollo; as, for instance, Manto, during
the fabulous age, with the Ismenian and Clarian
temples, and Cassandra with that of Thymbra, whose
nature was nearly allied to that of the sibyls, who likewise
were always connected with temples of the same
god. As to the manner in which the responses of the
Pythian priestess were delivered, Heracleitus of
Ephesus says, that <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the god, whose oracle is at
Delphi, neither utters nor conceals any thing, but
gives signs</span></span>;”</span><a id="noteref_1400" name="noteref_1400" href="#note_1400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1400</span></span></a> which at least serves to contradict
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the common idea of the designed ambiguity of this
oracle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This temple must however have lost much of its
dignity, when it condescended, for the sake of rich
offerings from the Lydian monarch, to answer enigmatically
the insidious questions which Crœsus put to
the Grecian oracles. In earlier times a Greek would
not have dared, without the greatest faith in its
responses, to approach the temple, which had regulated
almost the whole political state of Greece, conducted
its colonies, instituted the sacred armistices, and established
by its authority the legislation of Lycurgus.
For in general the god had not to announce what
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would</span></em>, but what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">should</span></em> take place; and he frequently
declared events not as to happen independently of his
injunction, but as the consequence of his answers. All
Dorians were in a certain state of dependence on the
Pythian temple; and as long as that race possessed
the ascendency in Greece, the hearth in the centre of
the earth (μεσόμφαλος ἑστία), with its eternal fire, at
Pytho,<a id="noteref_1401" name="noteref_1401" href="#note_1401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1401</span></span></a> was considered as the Prytaneum and religious
centre of the whole of Greece.<a id="noteref_1402" name="noteref_1402" href="#note_1402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1402</span></span></a>

9. In ancient Greece, however, prophecy was by no
means derived altogether from Apollo, but merely that
species of it which proceeded from a rapturous and
entranced state of the soul. Nevertheless, the enthusiastic
and imaginative frame of mind, in which cool
grottos, with their flowing waters and hollow echoes,
seemed to transport the votary into a former world,
was derived from the Nymphs: and the Bacidæ, who
were considered as under the influence of the Nymphs

Connecting the idea of Apollo, which we have now
acquired, with our preceding inquiries, we find the
whole combine in an easy and natural manner. Apollo,
as a divine hero, overcomes every obstacle to the order
and laws of heaven; and those are heavenly regulations
and laws which he proclaims as the prophet of Zeus.
By these, also, tranquillity, brightness, and harmony,
are every where established, and every thing destructive
of them is removed. The belief in a fixed system
of laws, of which Apollo was the executor, formed the
foundation of all prophecy in his worship.

10. We have next to consider for what reason and
to what extent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">music</span></em> was included among the solemnities
(τιμαὶ) in honour of Apollo. On this point, however,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we must guard against inferring too much from
the poets. By the ancients he was represented as
playing on the cithara (φόρμιγξ), frequently in the
midst of a chorus of Muses, singing and dancing;<a id="noteref_1409" name="noteref_1409" href="#note_1409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1409</span></span></a>
whose place in the Hymn to the Pythian Apollo is
filled by ten goddesses, among whom <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ares and
Hermes vault and spring</span></span>”</span> (perhaps like Cretan
tumblers or κυβιστητῆρες), <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">whilst Apollo, in a
beautifully woven garment, plays, and at the same
time dances with quick motion of the feet</span></span>;”</span> for
Apollo was not considered as merely a god of music;
thus Pindar addresses him as the god of dance.<a id="noteref_1410" name="noteref_1410" href="#note_1410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1410</span></span></a> But
we are not warranted from this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">poetical</span></em> fiction to infer
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religious</span></em> union of the Muses and Apollo, nor can
such a connexion be any where traced; indeed the
worship of these goddesses was, both in origin and
locality,<a id="noteref_1411" name="noteref_1411" href="#note_1411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1411</span></span></a> entirely
different from that of Apollo.
Besides, amongst the early writers, Apollo is never
considered as the patron of poets, or invoked, as the
Muses are, to grant poetical inspiration: players on the
cithara alone were under his protection. The cithara
was his attribute, both in many ancient statues<a id="noteref_1412" name="noteref_1412" href="#note_1412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1412</span></span></a> and
also on the coins of Delphi; it is his ancient and appropriate
instrument; the deeper-toned lyre, with its
arched sounding-board, Apollo received from Hermes:<a id="noteref_1413" name="noteref_1413" href="#note_1413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1413</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the instances in which he is represented as bearing it
are very rare.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. But for what reason is Apollo described as playing
upon the cithara? for no other, assuredly, than
that the music of the cithara was from times of remote
antiquity connected with his worship; and that, because
it appears best fitted to express a tranquil and
simple harmony; the worship of Apollo, as we have
frequently remarked, always endeavouring to produce
a solemn quiet and stillness of the soul. Pindar
beautifully says of this god that he <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">invented the
citharis and bestows the muse on whom he wills, in order to
introduce peaceful law into the heart</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_1414" name="noteref_1414" href="#note_1414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1414</span></span></a>
To this also refer the golden κηληδόνες, which, according
to the account of the same poet,<a id="noteref_1415" name="noteref_1415" href="#note_1415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1415</span></span></a>
were suspended from the roof of the brazen temple at Delphi; and they
were without doubt intended as emblems of the mild
and soothing influence of the god. This was naturally
the chief object of music when used in purifications,
and as an incantation (ἐπῳδὴ); when passions were to
be overcome, and pain soothed; and in ancient times
this was one of its most important applications.<a id="noteref_1416" name="noteref_1416" href="#note_1416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1416</span></span></a>
Chrysothemis, an ancient Pythian minstrel of mythology,
was hence called the son of Carmanor, the
expiatory priest of Tarrha;<a id="noteref_1417" name="noteref_1417" href="#note_1417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1417</span></span></a> as also Thaletas, the Cretan
poet, purified Sparta by music, when attacked with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the plague.<a id="noteref_1418" name="noteref_1418" href="#note_1418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1418</span></span></a> The Pythagoreans, who paid an
especial honour to Apollo, went still further, and employed
music as a charm to soothe the passions, attune the
spirit to harmony, and cure both body and mind.
Hence they much preferred the cithara to the flute,<a id="noteref_1419" name="noteref_1419" href="#note_1419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1419</span></span></a>
as, according to Grecian ideas, there was something in
the sound of the flute wild, and at the same time
gloomy; this, too, is the reason why Apollo disliked
the music of that instrument.<a id="noteref_1420" name="noteref_1420" href="#note_1420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1420</span></span></a> This also explains his
contest with Marsyas, the Phrygian Silenus and flute-player,
whose tough skin, having been stript off by the
conqueror, always moved (according to the report of
the inhabitants of Celænæ), with joy, as was believed,
at the sound of flutes.<a id="noteref_1421" name="noteref_1421" href="#note_1421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1421</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The flute was not an instrument of much antiquity
among the Greeks; Homer only mentions it as used
by the Trojans.<a id="noteref_1422" name="noteref_1422" href="#note_1422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1422</span></span></a> In the time of Hesiod it had been
introduced at the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">comus</span></span>,

But the cithara alone for a long time kept its place as
the instrument for the chorus: even in the time of
Alcman flute-players came mostly from Asia Minor;
and their names (Sambas, Adon, Telos<a id="noteref_1424" name="noteref_1424" href="#note_1424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1424</span></span></a>) frequently
had, from this circumstance, a barbarous sound. This
kind of music was principally adopted in places where
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Dionysus was worshipped; for instance, in Bœotia.
It was of course also much used in the rites of the
Phrygian Magna Mater, and of the Phrygian Pan:<a id="noteref_1425" name="noteref_1425" href="#note_1425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1425</span></span></a>
hence Pindar, who inherited the character of a flute-player
from his father, dedicated a shrine to the mother
of the gods, and to Pan.<a id="noteref_1426" name="noteref_1426" href="#note_1426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1426</span></span></a> When, however, it had become
common throughout Greece, it could not be excluded
from a place so celebrated for music as Delphi,
and Apollo's ear became less fastidious. Alcman and
Corinna, indeed, were too partial to that art (the
former as being a Lydian, the latter a Bœotian), when
they represented Apollo himself playing on the flute.<a id="noteref_1427" name="noteref_1427" href="#note_1427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1427</span></span></a>
This instrument, however, had at that time been
adopted even in the sacred exhibition of the Delphian
worship: a dirge on the death of the Python<a id="noteref_1428" name="noteref_1428" href="#note_1428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1428</span></span></a> (nominally

was played on the flute in the Lydian strain,
and probably formed a part of that dramatic representation.
Moreover, this instrument was used to accompany
Prosodia (songs which were sung on the way to
a temple) in the procession to Tempe, and in the
Pentathlon at the gymnastic contests.<a id="noteref_1430" name="noteref_1430" href="#note_1430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1430</span></span></a> A peculiar

combined with singing (αὐλῳδία), in lyric and elegiac

impression:<a id="noteref_1432" name="noteref_1432" href="#note_1432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1432</span></span></a>
for all sadness, and therefore all plaintive
strains, were every where excluded from the worship
of Apollo; and the music in his temples was always
intended to have an enlivening and tranquillizing effect
upon the mind.

the singular story of the contest of Apollo with Linus,
and of the defeat and consequent death of the latter.<a id="noteref_1433" name="noteref_1433" href="#note_1433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1433</span></span></a>
For this purpose it will be necessary to state shortly
my ideas respecting the real character of Linus.
Linus, then, the subject of the song called by his
name, was originally a god of an elementary religion
(in which there were numerous symbols to signify the
death of all animated life): he was nearly connected
with Narcissus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Torpid</span></em>), whose tomb was
shown at Thebes and Argos, at which last place matrons
and maidens bewailed him in the month Arneius,
as a boy brought up among lambs and torn in pieces
by dogs.<a id="noteref_1434" name="noteref_1434" href="#note_1434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1434</span></span></a> The song of lamentation for the untimely

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
harp in a low and subdued voice, and listened to with
pleasure in the times of Homer and Hesiod,<a id="noteref_1436" name="noteref_1436" href="#note_1436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1436</span></span></a> although
then, perhaps, the air was not always very melancholy.
But in after times this was its predominant character,
as is proved by the names Αἴλινος and Οἰτόλινος.<a id="noteref_1437" name="noteref_1437" href="#note_1437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1437</span></span></a> It
was a great favourite with the husbandmen,<a id="noteref_1438" name="noteref_1438" href="#note_1438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1438</span></span></a> who were
generally aboriginal inhabitants. In this point there
was a resemblance between the usages of ancient
Greece and Asia Minor, where religious dirges of this
description, different, indeed, in different districts, but
having every where the same mournful tune, were
customary.<a id="noteref_1439" name="noteref_1439" href="#note_1439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1439</span></span></a> Such were, for instance, the lament of

Gingras, or song of Adonis, and the Maneros, the rustic
song of Pelusium in Egypt, which Herodotus compares
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the Linus.<a id="noteref_1446" name="noteref_1446" href="#note_1446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1446</span></span></a> And even at Cyprus the contest
of the two opposite kinds of music was in some
measure renewed; there being a tradition that Cinyras,
the priest of Aphrodite, and composer of the mournful
strains in honour of Adonis, had, like Marsyas and
Linus, been overcome and put to death by Apollo.<a id="noteref_1447" name="noteref_1447" href="#note_1447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1447</span></span></a>

Thus we behold Apollo the representative of the
severe, even, and simple music of the Greeks, in contest
with that impassioned spirit, alternating between
the extremes of fury and apathy, which the professors
of an elementary religion sought to represent even in
their music; and consequently this fable also harmonizes
with the fundamental principles of the religion of
Apollo.

One of the most ancient species of composition (in
which Chrysothemis the Cretan and Philammon were
said to have contended at Delphi) was a hymn to
Apollo;<a id="noteref_1448" name="noteref_1448" href="#note_1448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1448</span></span></a> which we must suppose to have been composed
in the ancient Doric dialect, and sung simply to
the cithara. In reference to its musical execution,
this hymn was also called a
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nome</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1449" name="noteref_1449" href="#note_1449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1449</span></span></a> the invention of
which was ascribed to Apollo himself.<a id="noteref_1450" name="noteref_1450" href="#note_1450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1450</span></span></a>
At Delos
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also there were nomes, which were sung at the cyclic
choral dances, and were attributed to Olen, another
representative of the ancient poetry of hymns.<a id="noteref_1451" name="noteref_1451" href="#note_1451"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1451</span></span></a> The

the ancient composer of hymns, had placed
choruses of young women round the altar, who sang
the birth of Latona and her children in lyric measures
(ἐν μέλεσι),<a id="noteref_1455" name="noteref_1455" href="#note_1455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1455</span></span></a>

by Terpander the ancient lyric poet, appear to be confounded
with the original ones; since these, after the
fashion of the most ancient composers, contained only
hexameters.<a id="noteref_1457" name="noteref_1457" href="#note_1457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1457</span></span></a> The ancient religious poets mentioned
in these accounts, Chrysothemis, Philammon, and

certainty as the founders of the temples of Tarrha,
Delphi, and Patara, to which they particularly belonged.<a id="noteref_1458" name="noteref_1458" href="#note_1458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1458</span></span></a>
The language also of the poems ascribed to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them must have been Doric; though indeed the fact
of a poetical use of this dialect before the historic
times will not agree with the predominant, though
perhaps not well-grounded notions respecting the progress
of poetry in Greece.

14. That the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pæan</span></span> was a song of thanksgiving for
deliverance has been mentioned above. With respect,
however, to the manner in which it was performed, we
learn from Homer that it was sung after the sacrificial
feast,<a id="noteref_1459" name="noteref_1459" href="#note_1459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1459</span></span></a>
when the goblets were carried round after the
sacred libation; and this was also the case at Sparta
and Athens.<a id="noteref_1460" name="noteref_1460" href="#note_1460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1460</span></span></a> It was generally sung in a sitting posture,
although in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo that
god is represented as accompanying the Cretans who
sing in a measured step.<a id="noteref_1461" name="noteref_1461" href="#note_1461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1461</span></span></a> At Sparta it was danced

On the whole it required a regular and
sedate measure,<a id="noteref_1463" name="noteref_1463" href="#note_1463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1463</span></span></a>

air, as for the nome, and the solemn σπονδειακὸν, sung
at libations.<a id="noteref_1464" name="noteref_1464" href="#note_1464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1464</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the most lively dance which accompanied the
songs used in the worship of Apollo, was that termed
the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">hyporcheme</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1465" name="noteref_1465" href="#note_1465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1465</span></span></a> In this, besides the chorus of
singers who usually danced around the blazing altar,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
several persons were appointed to accompany the action
of the poem with an appropriate pantomimic display
(ὑπορχεῖσθαι). Homer himself bears witness to
the Cretan origin of this custom, since the Cnosian
dance, represented by Hephæstus on the shield of
Achilles, appears from the description to have been a
kind of hyporcheme,<a id="noteref_1466" name="noteref_1466" href="#note_1466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1466</span></span></a> and hence all dances of this
description were called Cretan.<a id="noteref_1467" name="noteref_1467" href="#note_1467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1467</span></span></a> From that island
they passed at an early period over to Delos, where,
even in Lucian's time, the wanderings of Latona and
her island, with their final repose, were represented in
the above manner.<a id="noteref_1468" name="noteref_1468" href="#note_1468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1468</span></span></a> At the same time also
probably took place the custom mentioned in the hymn to the
Delian Apollo as characterizing the songs of the
young women of that island; viz., that they represented
the voices and gestures of every nation:<a id="noteref_1469" name="noteref_1469" href="#note_1469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1469</span></span></a> perhaps
they introduced the peculiar dances of the various
countries which Latona visited in her wanderings.
The ludicrous, and at the same time complicated dance
(γέρανος) which Theseus is said first to have danced
with his crew round the altar at Delos,<a id="noteref_1470" name="noteref_1470" href="#note_1470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1470</span></span></a> was probably
of the same description. All that can be clearly ascertained
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
respecting the rhythm of these compositions
is that the hexameter was altogether unfitted to their
playful and joyous character.<a id="noteref_1471" name="noteref_1471" href="#note_1471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1471</span></span></a> But both the hyporcheme
and pæan were first indebted for their systematic
improvement to the Doric musicians, Xenodamus
of Sparta, and Thaletas of Elyrus in Crete
(about 620 B.C.),<a id="noteref_1472" name="noteref_1472" href="#note_1472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1472</span></span></a> who first brought the Cretic or
Pæonic metre into general use; which names point
out beyond doubt its Cretan origin, and its use in
pæans.<a id="noteref_1473" name="noteref_1473" href="#note_1473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1473</span></span></a> Cretics form a quick and lively, though a

particularly adapted to rapid motion. Thus a joyous
and agreeable harmony was added, at the festivals of
Apollo, to the serious and solemn music, although the
softness and insipidity of several Ionian and Asiatic
tunes were, without doubt, always rejected.

Thus, if we except the purifying and propitiatory

15. We have as yet omitted the mention of two
great national festivals celebrated at Amyclæ by the
Spartans in honour of the chief deity of their race,<a id="noteref_1478" name="noteref_1478" href="#note_1478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1478</span></span></a>
viz., the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyacinthia</span></span> and the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carnea</span></span>, from a belief
that they do not properly belong to Apollo. That
the worship of the Carnean Apollo, in which both
were included, was derived from Thebes, whence it
was brought over by the Ægidæ to Amyclæ, has been
proved in a former work;<a id="noteref_1479" name="noteref_1479" href="#note_1479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1479</span></span></a> our present object is to
show, from the symbols and rites of this worship, that
it was originally derived more from the ancient religion
of Demeter than from that of Apollo. The
youth Hyacinthus, whom the Carnean Apollo accidentally
struck with a quoit,<a id="noteref_1480" name="noteref_1480" href="#note_1480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1480</span></span></a> evidently took his name
from the flower (a dark-coloured species of iris),
which in the ancient symbolical language was an emblem
of death; and the fable of his death is clearly a
relic of an ancient elementary religion. Now the
hyacinth most frequently occurs, in this sense, in the
worship of Demeter; thus, for example, it was under
the name Κοσμοσάνδαλος sacred to Demeter Chthonia
at Hermione.<a id="noteref_1481" name="noteref_1481" href="#note_1481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1481</span></span></a> We find further proof of this in
the ancient sculptures with which the grave, and at the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
same time the altar of Hyacinthus, was adorned: the
artists indeed appear to have completely comprehended
the spirit of the worship. We find Demeter, Cora,
Pluto, and the Cadmean Dionysus, with Ino and Semele,
and Hyacinthus himself, together with a sister
named Polybœa.<a id="noteref_1482" name="noteref_1482" href="#note_1482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1482</span></span></a> Polybœa is hardly,

Melibœa. To this may be added the sacrifices to the
dead, and lamentations customary on the first day<a id="noteref_1484" name="noteref_1484" href="#note_1484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1484</span></span></a>

nightly processions,<a id="noteref_1485" name="noteref_1485" href="#note_1485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1485</span></span></a> and several other detached
traces of the symbols of Demeter and Dionysus,<a id="noteref_1486" name="noteref_1486" href="#note_1486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1486</span></span></a> which, by
an attentive observer, may be easily distinguished from
those of Apollo. The time of the festival was also
different: it took place on the longest day of the
Spartan month Hecatombeus, which corresponds to
the Attic Hecatombæon,<a id="noteref_1487" name="noteref_1487" href="#note_1487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1487</span></span></a> at the time when Hylas was

The Carnean festival took place, as it appears, in
the following month to the Hyacinthian, equally in
honour of Apollo of Amyclæ. But the Doric religion
seems here to have preponderated, and to have
supplanted the elementary symbols so evident in the
Hyacinthia. The Carnea was, as far as we know,
altogether a warlike festival, similar to the Attic Boëdromia.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It lasted nine days, during which time nine
tents were pitched near the city, in each of which
nine men lived, for the time of the festival, in the
manner of a military camp. There is no reference to
an elementary religion except some obscure ceremonies
of the priest Agetes and the Carneatæ.<a id="noteref_1488" name="noteref_1488" href="#note_1488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1488</span></span></a> This
leads us to suppose that at the union of the Amyclæan
worship, introduced by the Ægidæ, with the Doric
worship of Apollo at Sparta, the Hyacinthia preserved
more of the peculiarities of the former, the Carnea of
the latter, although the sacred rites of both were completely
united. At the same time we do not deny the
difficulty of inquiring into the origin and primitive
form of ceremonies the history of which is so complicated;
and this alone must excuse the shortness of
our account respecting these two festivals.

16. Finally, the manner in which Apollo is represented
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sculpture</span></em>, particularly by the ancient artists,
may assist our investigation into the ideas and sentiments
on which his worship was founded. Apollo
was a subject peculiarly adapted for sculpture. Since
his connexion with elementary religion was slight, and
there was nothing mystic in his character, the sculptors
were soon able to fix upon a regular cast of features,
to distinguish him from other deities: for Apollo, not
only in poetry, but in the fables most nearly connected
with his worship, is generally represented as a human
god, and in all his actions and sufferings more nearly
connected with the heroes than any other divinity.
But before this perfection and conventional uniformity
of the art, the early sculptors were much assisted in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
characterizing the statues of Apollo by his numerous
and significant symbols, such as the bow, the cithara,
the laurel, &amp;c.: and thus they were able, in some
measure, to give an idea of the power and properties
of Apollo, though merely in stiff and rude images of
wood and stone.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<a name="Book_II_Chapter_VIII_Section_17" id="Book_II_Chapter_VIII_Section_17" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
17. The simple Cippus of Apollo Agyieus did not
represent any particular attribute, but was merely intended
as a memorial of the presence of the protecting
god.<a id="noteref_1489" name="noteref_1489" href="#note_1489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1489</span></span></a> In endeavouring more fully to express his
character, the symbols of power would naturally come
next. His attributes of vengeance doubtless preceded
those of mercy, although both, in fact, harmonized
together: it must, however, have been long, before the
surpassing beauty of the god (celebrated even in the
Theogony of Hesiod) could be the subject of sculpture.
The attribute, then, of strength, as also that of omniscience,
the ancient Lacedæmonians wished to represent
by the Apollo with four hands and four ears at
Amyclæ.<a id="noteref_1490" name="noteref_1490" href="#note_1490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1490</span></span></a> But the chief statue on the above spot was
an image, which, besides the bow, bore a helmet and
lance: of the same nature was also the statue on mount
Thornax, the face of which had been gilded by the
Lacedæmonians.<a id="noteref_1491" name="noteref_1491" href="#note_1491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1491</span></span></a> The Megarians also consecrated
at Delphi a statue of Apollo bearing a lance;<a id="noteref_1492" name="noteref_1492" href="#note_1492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1492</span></span></a> and at
Tenedos he was armed with the double hatchet,<a id="noteref_1493" name="noteref_1493" href="#note_1493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1493</span></span></a> like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Labrandenian Zeus of the Carians.<a id="noteref_1494" name="noteref_1494" href="#note_1494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1494</span></span></a> In a very
ancient bas-relief, discovered by Dodwell on the mouth

examine further, Apollo holds the cithara in his hand;<a id="noteref_1495" name="noteref_1495" href="#note_1495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1495</span></span></a>
his whole form too, as in all the ancient sculptures, is
stouter and more manly than usual.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
18. On inquiring concerning the artists of the most
ancient symbolical statues of Apollo, we find that the
Cretans were the first sculptors, as well as musicians,
of that worship. From Crete, an ancient wooden
statue of Apollo, of the rudest style of workmanship,
was brought to Delphi:<a id="noteref_1496" name="noteref_1496" href="#note_1496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1496</span></span></a> from hence, too (about
Olymp. 50, 580 B.C.), there came Dipœnus and
Scyllis the Dædalidæ, who made for the Sicyonians
statues of Apollo, Artemis, Hercules, and Athene, of
which we will speak hereafter. The Pythian oracle
greatly interested itself in the labours of these artists;
for when the envy of the native artists had driven them
from Sicyon, it compelled the inhabitants to recall
them. The managers of the temple of Delphi appear
indeed to have been, from very early times, great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
patrons of the art of sculpture, particularly in brass.
The subterranean temple at Pytho (the existence of
which has been doubted, but, in my opinion, without
sufficient grounds) was covered with brass, as were
several treasuries of the ancient princes of Greece.
The temples and courts were fitted with numerous tripods;
caldrons, goblets, and arms of brass were there
arranged promiscuously, from periods of the highest
antiquity. There was also a knife used in sacrifice
called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Delphian knife</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1497" name="noteref_1497" href="#note_1497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1497</span></span></a> nor do the singing golden
Κηληδόνες, which Pindar represents as suspended from
the roof of the brazen temple, seem to be a mere
poetical fiction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Cretan school of sculpture produced Tectæus
and Angelion, who erected the celebrated, and
probably colossal statue of Apollo at Delos, which (as
was before mentioned) held the Graces in one hand
and a bow in the other. With the same school also,
though in a more distant degree, was connected Canachus
of Sicyon, who, about the seventy-third Olympiad,
made a famous bronze statue for the Didymæum,<a id="noteref_1498" name="noteref_1498" href="#note_1498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1498</span></span></a> and
one of wood for the Ismenium. From the accounts
and various imitations of this work of art we are
enabled to form some idea of its character. The god
was represented with a manly form, his breast broad
and prominent, the trunk square, the legs almost like
pillars, and in a firm position, the left leg being a little
advanced. The hair, encircled with a fillet, lay in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
slender twisted curls over the forehead; over each
shoulder were three platted tresses, and behind the
hair fell in a broad cluster down the back. The
countenance nearly resembled those in the marbles of
Ægina. In the right hand, which was stretched
straight forward, was a fawn (an obscure symbol
which we shall not here attempt to explain); the left,
not quite so much elevated, grasped a bow. The
whole must have had an awful and imposing appearance,
conveying the idea of sublimity and dignity far
more than of grace or loveliness.<a id="noteref_1499" name="noteref_1499" href="#note_1499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1499</span></span></a> We cannot suppose
the style of the colossal statue of Apollo to have
been very different which, several Olympiads later, was
modelled in brass by Calamis for Apollonia on the
Pontus, and which was afterwards brought to Rome by
Lucullus:<a id="noteref_1500" name="noteref_1500" href="#note_1500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1500</span></span></a> nor that of Apollo Alexicacus, erected at
Athens by the same artist at the beginning of the Peloponnesian
war.<a id="noteref_1501" name="noteref_1501" href="#note_1501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1501</span></span></a> The Apollo which Onatas of Ægina,
the contemporary of Calamis, executed for the inhabitants
of Pergamus, was a colossal statue displaying
great beauty of form, and, as it appears, of a more
youthful appearance than was common for statues of
Apollo at that time.<a id="noteref_1502" name="noteref_1502" href="#note_1502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1502</span></span></a> In this, Apollo was represented
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as καλλίτεκνος, as the beautiful son of Latona; under
which name he was worshipped at Pergamus.<a id="noteref_1503" name="noteref_1503" href="#note_1503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1503</span></span></a> It is
not improbable that the union of strength and beauty
so conspicuously exhibited in the ideal forms of the two
children of Latona was suggested by the peculiar
character of the Doric education; and that the artist
represented the god as an Ephebus, whose skill in the
chorus and on the field of battle was exactly equal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the figure which we are accustomed to consider
as properly belonging to Apollo did not originate even
in the school of Polycletus and Myron,<a id="noteref_1504" name="noteref_1504" href="#note_1504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1504</span></span></a> but was the
creation of a later period; since both the coins of a date
prior to the time of Alexander,<a id="noteref_1505" name="noteref_1505" href="#note_1505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1505</span></span></a> and single heads, which
must be referred to the same period,<a id="noteref_1506" name="noteref_1506" href="#note_1506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1506</span></span></a> do not indeed
preserve the features ascribed to the work of Canachus,
but still are quite different from the most celebrated of
the statues now extant, having broader cheeks, a
shorter and thicker nose; in a word, the proportions
are what the ancients termed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quadrate</span></em>, or square. It
was not till the times of Scopas, Leochares, Praxiteles,
and Timarchides, that the Apollo appeared whom we
may call the twin-brother of Venus, so similar are the
forms of both deities. The expression of inspiration
and ecstasy, which several of the best statues exhibit,
may also be shown to have first originated in the
school of Scopas, since the earlier artists aimed rather
at producing the appearance of tranquillity and composure
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than of transient excitement; and the exquisite
taste with which these sculptors were able to express
inspiration without extravagance, deserves the highest
praise. Without detailing the particular productions
of these and later artists, we shall only show how they
may be best classified. The Apollo Callinicus of
Belvedere stands by itself, swelling with the pride of
victory:<a id="noteref_1507" name="noteref_1507" href="#note_1507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1507</span></span></a> next comes the Apollo resting from the fight,
with the right arm bent over the head, the left leaning
on a pillar, holding the bow, which has evidently been
used, or a cithara: being evidently a statue of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">resting
Apollo</span></span> (Ἀπόλλων ἀναπαυόμενος); but from the circumstance
that a statue of this kind stood in the Lyceum
at Athens<a id="noteref_1508" name="noteref_1508" href="#note_1508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1508</span></span></a> it is usually called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Apollo of the
Lyceum:”</span> then follows the Apollo Citharœdus
(playing on the harp), either naked, in different positions,
or covered with the Pythian stola, and in an
almost theatrical attitude.<a id="noteref_1509" name="noteref_1509" href="#note_1509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1509</span></span></a> It would be foreign to our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
subject to enter into details respecting this class of
statues, and those derived from them, as the Sauroctonus,
Nomius, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
19. Finally, we would endeavour to trace the influence
of the worship of Apollo on the policy and
philosophy of Greece, if the question did not embrace
so wide a field, lying, as it does in great measure,
beyond the confines of history. We may, however,
select, from what has been already said, as proofs of
the influence of this worship on political concerns, the
armistice connected with the festivals of Apollo, the
truce observed in the sacred places and roads, the
soothing influence of the purifications for homicide,
together with the idea of the punishing and avenging
god, and the great influence of the oracles in the regulation
of public affairs.<a id="noteref_1510" name="noteref_1510" href="#note_1510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1510</span></span></a> It has, moreover, been frequently
remarked how by its sanctity, by the dignified
and severe character of its music, by all its symbols
and rites, this worship endeavoured to lull the minds
of individuals into a state of composure and security,
consistently, however, with an occasional elevation to
a state of ecstatic delight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
20. Lastly, the worship of Apollo was so nearly
connected with a branch of Grecian philosophy that
the one frequently established and explained scientifically
that which the other left merely to the feeling;
I mean the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pythagorean system</span></span>. Pythagoras possessed
hereditary rites of Apollo; he dwelt at Croton,
where that god received such various honours;<a id="noteref_1511" name="noteref_1511" href="#note_1511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1511</span></span></a> he
lived mostly among Dorians, who were everywhere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
partial to that worship; and a Delphian priestess, by
name Aristocleia, is mentioned among his followers.<a id="noteref_1512" name="noteref_1512" href="#note_1512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1512</span></span></a>
Thus it is not without reason that the Pythagorean
philosophy has in modern times been considered as
Doric: in its political doctrines it followed Doric principles,
and with the Doric religion it was united both
externally and internally: besides which, the attempt
to realize and disseminate national ideas and opinions
may perhaps illustrate the rapid growth of the power
of the Pythagorean league. The recondite principle
of this philosophy always is, that the essence of things
lies in their due measure and proportion, their system
and regularity; that everything exists by harmony and
symmetry alone; and that the world itself is an union
of all these proportions (κόσμος, or order). The same
abstraction from materiality also belonged to the religion
of Apollo; for this too suggests the idea of order,
harmony, and regularity, and in these it makes the
nature and actions of the Deity to consist. Hence,
too, music was one chief ingredient of the Pythagorean
philosophy, as well as a necessary element of the worship
of Apollo, as best expressing the harmony on
which both were founded. In both the soothing and
appeasing of the passions was aimed at and effected,
that the mind might be quieted and strengthened at
the same time.<a id="noteref_1513" name="noteref_1513" href="#note_1513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1513</span></span></a> But we must leave the full investigation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of this subject to those who have acquired a profounder
knowledge of the philosophy of Pythagoras.

1. We now proceed to consider the worship of
Artemis; a subject which need not be so fully examined
as that of Apollo, as it does not, like the
worship of that god, everywhere present the same
fundamental notions, and therefore cannot, in all its
first beginnings, be derived from the religion of the
Dorians. But as in general the Grecian mythology
adopted the most various and inconsistent religious
views and ideas, so in the name of the single goddess
Artemis were united almost opposite branches of
ancient worship, which we must attempt to separate.
Lest, however, it should be supposed that we are
unable to trace the association of ideas, which saw a
simple character in the <span class="tei tei-q">“various forms of that great
goddess, who, having her origin in the interior of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Asia, passed from thence into Greece, and was worshipped
as the moon, the goddess of the woods, the
huntress, the nurse of children, and a nurse of the
universe, as well by the choruses of the virgins of
Caryæ, as in the dances of the temples;”</span><a id="noteref_1514" name="noteref_1514" href="#note_1514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1514</span></span></a> we will
endeavour to ascertain some historical criterion, which
may distinguish the worship of Artemis from that of
any other deity, and which must not be one of the ideas
or symbols of the worship itself, since it is concerning
the possibility or impossibility of their connexion that
we are to inquire.

2. For this purpose it may be assumed, that the
Artemis connected with Apollo belongs alone to
the same system of religious notions: and consequently,
the Artemis of Ephesus, Artemis Orthia,
and Artemis Tauropolus, are of a different nature, as
Apollo is never represented as their brother: of this,
however, more hereafter. Here we will first show,
that in all the chief temples of Apollo, Artemis was
worshipped as his sister, as the partner of his nature
and of his actions, and, as it were, a part of the same
deity. Thus both were children of Latona, and were
equally the rulers of the temple of Delphi;<a id="noteref_1515" name="noteref_1515" href="#note_1515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1515</span></span></a> the

referred also to Artemis. She is also the goddess of
sudden death;<a id="noteref_1531" name="noteref_1531" href="#note_1531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1531</span></span></a> which she sometimes inflicts in wrath,

always represented as unmarried; and therefore not
as the deity of an elementary religion, and originally
not as goddess of the moon, although it cannot be
denied that the worship of the moon was very nearly
connected with other branches of the worship of
Artemis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, it may be asked, if this Artemis always has
the same characteristics as Apollo, and has none that
are peculiar to herself, why should there be two deities
to express one idea? Wherefore both a male and
female, if neither have any relation to sex? It is
difficult to give a satisfactory answer to these questions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This consideration may, however, in some measure
assist; namely, that as soon as Apollo was once supposed
to be as an earthly god, as the ideal of all human
strength, it was necessary to add also a female being.
And the near approximation of the male to the female
deity may be accounted for by the condition of the
Doric women, who were much more considered as
independent beings, and possessed a capability for all
those other things which adorn the other sex.

3. But the most difficult part of our problem still
remains unsolved; viz. to ascertain what was the
worship of Artemis, which had not the same origin
and nature with that of Apollo. First of all we
should mention the Arcadian. That goddess has
nowhere so many temples as in Arcadia; she was
there the national deity, and had been long revered,
under the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hymnia</span></span>”</span>, by all the races of that
people.<a id="noteref_1548" name="noteref_1548" href="#note_1548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1548</span></span></a> She was also introduced under the name of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Callisto into the national genealogies, and called the
daughter of Lycaon<a id="noteref_1549" name="noteref_1549" href="#note_1549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1549</span></span></a> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of the Lycæan Zeus), and
mother of Arcas (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of the Arcadian people). For
that Callisto is only another form of the name of
Artemis Calliste, which is a common epithet of
Artemis, is plain from the fact that the tomb of that
heroine was shown in the temple of the goddess,<a id="noteref_1550" name="noteref_1550" href="#note_1550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1550</span></span></a> and
that Callisto was said to be changed into a bear, which
was the symbol of the Arcadian Artemis.<a id="noteref_1551" name="noteref_1551" href="#note_1551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1551</span></span></a> Afterwards,
indeed, the fable was much altered; and it
was related that Artemis changed Callisto into a bear
merely from anger.<a id="noteref_1552" name="noteref_1552" href="#note_1552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1552</span></span></a> But that this ancient Arcadian
deity was not the Doric Artemis is proved by the
above-mentioned criterion; viz. that she has no connexion
with Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another circumstance, however, speaks even still
plainer. Apollo and his sister seldom received any
particular surnames from places where they were
worshipped;<a id="noteref_1553" name="noteref_1553" href="#note_1553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1553</span></span></a> whereas the other Artemis has almost
innumerable names from the mountains, hills, fountains,
and waters of Arcadia, and the other regions of
Peloponnesus. Hence Alcman remarks that the
goddess bears the names of thousands of hills, cities,
and rivers.<a id="noteref_1554" name="noteref_1554" href="#note_1554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1554</span></span></a> There must have been, therefore, something
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the attributes of this Arcadian Artemis which
produced such a number of local names; she must
have been considered as united and connected with
the country in which she was worshipped. This
leads to the notion of an elementary goddess, of a
similar, though more universal nature than nymphs of
the mountains, rivers, and brooks. Accordingly we
find that this ancient Peloponnesian Artemis was
nearly connected with lakes, fountains, and rivers.
She was worshipped in several places under the titles
of Limnatis and Heleia.<a id="noteref_1555" name="noteref_1555" href="#note_1555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1555</span></span></a> There were frequently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also fountains in the temples of Artemis: viz., at
Corinth, Marius, Mothone,<a id="noteref_1556" name="noteref_1556" href="#note_1556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1556</span></span></a> and near the district of
Derrhiatis in Laconia.<a id="noteref_1557" name="noteref_1557" href="#note_1557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1557</span></span></a> She likewise received
great honours at the Clitorian fountain of Lusi.<a id="noteref_1558" name="noteref_1558" href="#note_1558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1558</span></span></a> Among
rivers, those she was most connected with are the
Cladeus and the Alpheus.<a id="noteref_1559" name="noteref_1559" href="#note_1559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1559</span></span></a> The moist and watery
district, through which this latter stream flows into
the sea, was filled with temples of the nymphs of
Aphrodite and Artemis, among which the sanctuary
of the Alphean Artemis<a id="noteref_1560" name="noteref_1560" href="#note_1560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1560</span></span></a> is most remarkable. There
were in that temple paintings of Cleanthus and
Aregon of Corinth, which were chiefly on subjects
relating to religion; as, for instance, that of Poseidon
presenting a thunny-fish to Zeus while in the act
of producing Athene.<a id="noteref_1561" name="noteref_1561" href="#note_1561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1561</span></span></a> All this naturally suggests
the idea of a goddess who produced a flourishing and
vigorous life from the element of water; and hence
we would not entirely reject the popular faith of the
Phigaleans, that Eurynome, the goddess of fish, and herself represented
as half a fish, was an Artemis.<a id="noteref_1562" name="noteref_1562" href="#note_1562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1562</span></span></a>

4. The mention of the river Alpheus reminds us
of Sicily, whither, in order to catch the fountain
Arethusa, which was swallowed up in the land of
Elis, he is said to have followed her under the sea,
and to have first reached her in the island of Ortygia,
near Syracuse.<a id="noteref_1563" name="noteref_1563" href="#note_1563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1563</span></span></a> This singular fable may perhaps be
explained by the following considerations. Syracuse
was founded in the 5th Olympiad by Corinthians,
with whom were some settlers from the district of
Olympia, and particularly some members of the family
of the Iamidæ, who held a sacred office at the altar of
the Olympian Zeus.<a id="noteref_1564" name="noteref_1564" href="#note_1564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1564</span></span></a> These joint colonists (συνοιχιστῆρες
according to the expression of Pindar) appear
to have had sufficient weight in the new city to introduce
their own religion and mythology. For, as we
have seen above, Artemis was worshipped at Olympia
as the goddess of the Alpheus, being generally considered
in that country as presiding over lakes and
rivers. She had in the grove of Altis an altar,
together with Alpheus;<a id="noteref_1565" name="noteref_1565" href="#note_1565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1565</span></span></a> and there was there a popular
legend, that Alpheus had once loved Artemis.
Now the settlers that went from this district to Syracuse,
in their first expedition, confined themselves to
the island of Ortygia. Here they built a temple to
the river-goddess Artemis; a sanctuary of so great
fame, that Pindar calls the whole island <span class="tei tei-q">“the seat
of Artemis, the river-goddess.<a id="noteref_1566" name="noteref_1566" href="#note_1566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1566</span></span></a>”</span> There was,
however, no river in Ortygia, and therefore Artemis was
supposed to regret her beloved Alpheus. Hence
arose the belief that Arethusa, a fountain near the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
temple, contained the sacred water of the Alpheus;<a id="noteref_1567" name="noteref_1567" href="#note_1567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1567</span></span></a>
a belief which was strengthened by the circumstance
that large fish were found in the spring;<a id="noteref_1568" name="noteref_1568" href="#note_1568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1568</span></span></a> and from
this arose the fable that Alpheus had followed the
goddess to Sicily. But Artemis was supposed to fly
from the pursuit of Alpheus.<a id="noteref_1569" name="noteref_1569" href="#note_1569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1569</span></span></a> This at least was the
fiction followed by Telesilla, a poetess who lived in
the 64th Olympiad;<a id="noteref_1570" name="noteref_1570" href="#note_1570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1570</span></span></a> and the same fable was
perhaps adopted by Pindar.<a id="noteref_1571" name="noteref_1571" href="#note_1571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1571</span></span></a> Afterwards, however, the precise
meaning and origin of this fable were forgotten;
and the fountain-nymph Arethusa took the place of
Artemis, and became the object of the pursuit of the
river-god.<a id="noteref_1572" name="noteref_1572" href="#note_1572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1572</span></span></a> Such appears to have been the origin of
the elegant fable of Alpheus and Arethusa.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now return to the Peloponnesian Artemis, and
will mention some of her other symbols and attributes.
Her statue stood next to that of Demeter,
at Megalopolis, dressed in the skin of a deer, with
a quiver on her back, holding a torch in one hand,
and two serpents in the other, with a dog by her
side.<a id="noteref_1573" name="noteref_1573" href="#note_1573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1573</span></span></a>
The connexion which existed between her and the
Arcadian Demeter is probably more ancient than this
statue; and indeed the symbol of the deer seems to
have been common in Arcadia to both Artemis and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Cora, called in Arcadia <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">despœna</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1574" name="noteref_1574" href="#note_1574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1574</span></span></a> She was also
worshipped with Bacchus;<a id="noteref_1575" name="noteref_1575" href="#note_1575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1575</span></span></a> and, like him, had phallic
festivals.<a id="noteref_1576" name="noteref_1576" href="#note_1576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1576</span></span></a> From her connexion with fountains and
rivers, and other rural objects, it was natural that this
Artemis should be considered as the patron of wild
animals. Thus Æschylus calls her <span class="tei tei-q">“the protectress of young
lions, and the whelps of other wild beasts.”</span><a id="noteref_1577" name="noteref_1577" href="#note_1577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1577</span></span></a>
In like manner she was supposed to preside over the
breeding of horses,<a id="noteref_1578" name="noteref_1578" href="#note_1578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1578</span></span></a> and generally over the nurture of
infants and children;<a id="noteref_1579" name="noteref_1579" href="#note_1579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1579</span></span></a> it was therefore by a perversion
of the original idea that she took the character of a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
huntress, the enemy and destroyer of wild animals.
An analogous inconsistency to that before pointed out
in the attributes of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Doric</span></span> Apollo and Artemis,
who were represented as both protecting and
destroying.<a id="noteref_1580" name="noteref_1580" href="#note_1580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1580</span></span></a>

5. By the mythological symbol of Artemis Callisto,
the bear, we are reminded of some ceremonies at
Athens, where young girls, between the ages of five
and ten years (who were consecrated to the Munychian
and Brauronian Artemis), were called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bears</span></em>;<a id="noteref_1581" name="noteref_1581" href="#note_1581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1581</span></span></a>

6. The consideration of the Attic festival of Artemis
leads again to another variety of the worship of
Artemis; viz., to that of Artemis Orthosia, Orthia,
or Iphigenia. We will first give the traditions and
facts as we find them. Iphigenia, coming from
Tauria to Attica, was supposed to have landed at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Brauron, and at the neighbouring Halæ Araphenides,
and left behind her the ancient wooden image of Artemis.<a id="noteref_1585" name="noteref_1585" href="#note_1585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1585</span></span></a>
Here she was immediately interwoven with
the heroic genealogy, and called the daughter of Theseus.<a id="noteref_1586" name="noteref_1586" href="#note_1586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1586</span></span></a>
In Sparta there was a temple of Artemis
Orthia in a damp part of the city, called Limnæum,
where was also shown a wooden statue, which had
come from Tauria.<a id="noteref_1587" name="noteref_1587" href="#note_1587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1587</span></span></a> As to the introduction of the
worship, it is said that Astrabacus and Alopecus (the
ass and fox), the sons of Irbus, descendants of Agis
in the fourth generation (about 900 B.C.), had found
the image in a bush, and had been struck mad by the
sight of it; that the Limnatæ, and other villages of
Sparta, had upon this offered sacrifices to them, when
a quarrel arose, and murder ensued. A number of
men were killed at the altar; and accordingly the
goddess called for victims to atone for the pollution;
instead of which, in later times, the scourging of boys
was instituted, over the severity of which the priestess
presided.<a id="noteref_1588" name="noteref_1588" href="#note_1588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1588</span></span></a> It is remarkable that this was immediately

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From this narration it follows that the scourging was
considered as a substitute for human sacrifice; and
further, that the worship was looked upon as of a
foreign origin: notwithstanding this, it was completely
interwoven into the Lacedæmonian mythology. For
it can be shown that the pretended daughter of Agamemnon,
Iphigenia, is no other than the Taurian goddess,
who was actually worshipped in several cities of
Greece under the name of Ἰφιγένεια. Considered as
a heroine, indeed, she became first, instead of the goddess
thirsting for human sacrifice, the virgin sacrificed
to her; and, secondly, her sacrificing priestess.<a id="noteref_1590" name="noteref_1590" href="#note_1590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1590</span></span></a> According
to the Cyprian poems (for Homer knew
nothing of her) Iphigenia was sacrificed to Artemis;
but was by her brought to Tauria, and made immortal,
a deer (or, according to others, a bear, and also a bull)
having been left in her place;<a id="noteref_1591" name="noteref_1591" href="#note_1591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1591</span></span></a> Hesiod also represented her
as immortal, viz., as Hecate.<a id="noteref_1592" name="noteref_1592" href="#note_1592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1592</span></span></a> The sacrifice was
supposed to have taken place at Aulis, because there
was a temple (probably of the Orthosian Artemis)
near the port, to whom sacrifices were made at the
passage.<a id="noteref_1593" name="noteref_1593" href="#note_1593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1593</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This worship probably came to Laconia from Lemnos,<a id="noteref_1594" name="noteref_1594" href="#note_1594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1594</span></span></a>
one of its principal seats. In early tradition Lemnos
was probably identical with Tauria,<a id="noteref_1595" name="noteref_1595" href="#note_1595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1595</span></span></a> and the
latter country derived its poetical name from the symbol
of the bull, in the same manner as Lycia in later
times took its name from the symbol of the wolf. In
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lemnos also a great goddess was anciently worshipped
with sacrifices of virgins; to which place the wooden
image is said to have been brought from Brauron.
This opinion becomes more evident by a comparison
with the worship of Chryse. Agamemnon is said to
have been the father of Chryse as well as of Iphigenia,<a id="noteref_1596" name="noteref_1596" href="#note_1596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1596</span></span></a> and also, according to others, of a son Chryses,
who went to Tauria with Orestes.<a id="noteref_1597" name="noteref_1597" href="#note_1597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1597</span></span></a> Now it is certain
that Chryse was a goddess, who had from early times
been worshipped both at Lemnos and Samothrace.
The Argonauts under Hercules and Jason were said
to have sacrificed to her; and her ancient wooden
image, raised over an hearth of unhewn stones, is
often represented on ancient vases.<a id="noteref_1598" name="noteref_1598" href="#note_1598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1598</span></span></a> Philoctetes is
said to have been bitten by the viper<a id="noteref_1599" name="noteref_1599" href="#note_1599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1599</span></span></a> when he discovered

is also called Athene, was probably only a different form of
her sister Iphigenia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worship of both these goddesses spread to other
places, to the north of the Ægean sea. Thus on the
coast of Byzantium there was an altar of Artemis
Orthosia;<a id="noteref_1601" name="noteref_1601" href="#note_1601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1601</span></span></a> and opposite to it, at Chrysopolis,
was the tomb of Chryses, the son of Agamemnon, who, in his
search after Iphigenia, was said to have died there.<a id="noteref_1602" name="noteref_1602" href="#note_1602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1602</span></span></a>
It is evident that this system of religious names was
arbitrarily transferred to the genealogy of the Lacedæmonian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
kings, and most curiously interwoven with
the Trojan mythology. The Greeks first became
acquainted with Tauria by their voyages to Miletus;
and they gave it a name already celebrated in their
mythology. They found there some sanguinary rites
of a goddess, which, by partly softening the name,
they called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oreiloche</span></span>;<a id="noteref_1603" name="noteref_1603" href="#note_1603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1603</span></span></a> they also found human sacrifices,
which they supposed to be offered to Iphigenia;<a id="noteref_1604" name="noteref_1604" href="#note_1604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1604</span></span></a>
their own worship of that deity bore so many marks
of ancient barbarism, that they were willing to consider
the northern barbarians as its authors. Yet it
is certain that the Tauric Artemis was no more derived
from the Taurians, than the Æthiopian Artemis
from the Æthiopians,<a id="noteref_1605" name="noteref_1605" href="#note_1605"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1605</span></span></a> &amp;c.

there were modes of worship, which the Greeks compared
with the rites of the Orthosian Artemis, of the
similarity of which we shall presently treat.

7. Hitherto we have merely collected the fabulous
narrations of the ancients, and attempted to show
their connexion; we shall next speak of the ceremonies
which attended the worship of this goddess or
goddesses.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place we will treat of the meaning and
character of this truly mystical worship.<a id="noteref_1607" name="noteref_1607" href="#note_1607"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1607</span></span></a> We have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a goddess adored with frantic and enthusiastic orgies,
certain signs of an elementary religion, as well as
with human sacrifices, which the character of the
Greeks endeavoured only to moderate and to ennoble;
it appears to have originally resembled the Arcadian
worship of Callisto; but that it acquired at Lemnos,
from the proximity of the Asiatic religion, a wilder
and more extravagant form, which it retained after its
return to Attica and Laconia. It cannot be a matter
of doubt that Artemis Tauropolus is nearly identical
with the Taurian goddess; this name of the goddess
was established in Samos (where cakes of sesamy and
honey were offered to her on solemn festivals),<a id="noteref_1608" name="noteref_1608" href="#note_1608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1608</span></span></a> in the

The ceremonies were undoubtedly enthusiastic, as the
goddess herself was considered as striking the mind
with madness;<a id="noteref_1611" name="noteref_1611" href="#note_1611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1611</span></span></a> and bloody, because the worship at
Aricia was considered like it.<a id="noteref_1612" name="noteref_1612" href="#note_1612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1612</span></span></a>

8. We are now to consider those temples of Artemis
which had a purely Asiatic, and not a Grecian origin,
and are wholly distinct, not only from the Doric, but
also from the Arcadian worship of Artemis.

The Ephesian Artemis was doubtless found by the
Ionians, when they settled on that coast, as already an
object of worship, in her temple,<a id="noteref_1613" name="noteref_1613" href="#note_1613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1613</span></span></a> situated in a marshy

resemblance in the attributes of the Munychian and
Ephesian goddesses, they called the latter <span class="tei tei-q">“Artemis;”</span>

Every thing that is related of the worship of this deity
is singular and foreign to the Greeks. Her constant
symbol is the bee, which is not otherwise attributed
to Artemis; the other attributes, which adorned her
statues in later times, are too far-fetched to admit of
any conclusion being drawn from them. The bee,
however, appears originally to have been the symbol
of nourishment;<a id="noteref_1616" name="noteref_1616" href="#note_1616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1616</span></span></a> the chief priest himself was called

9. Thus much concerns the character of this worship,
which appears, like an isolated point, projecting
from a religious system, otherwise confined to the
western parts of Greece.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to its origin, the unanimous tradition of antiquity
is that it was founded by the Amazons, This legend
had probably been mentioned in some of the ancient
epic poems before it was alluded to by Pindar;<a id="noteref_1624" name="noteref_1624" href="#note_1624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1624</span></span></a> and
that it was also preserved on the spot appears from the
celebrated contest of Phidias, Polycleitus, and other
artists, to make statues of Amazons for the Ephesian
temple: lately also a sarcophagus was found near
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Ephesus representing the battle of the
Amazons.<a id="noteref_1625" name="noteref_1625" href="#note_1625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1625</span></span></a>
The traditions respecting the foundation of the cities
of Smyrna, Cume, Myrlea, Myrina, Æolis, Priene,
Mytilene, and Pitane also make mention of the Amazons.<a id="noteref_1626" name="noteref_1626" href="#note_1626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1626</span></span></a>
With respect to the meaning of Amazons, it
has rightly (in my opinion) been supposed that the
idea of them was suggested by the sight of the innumerable
female slaves (ἱερόδουλοι) who were employed
about the temples of Asia Minor.<a id="noteref_1627" name="noteref_1627" href="#note_1627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1627</span></span></a> According to Callimachus
also the Amazons danced to the sound of the
pipe round the statue which had been newly raised on
the trunk of an elm-tree. It is also stated as an historical
fact, that, even in the times of the Ionians,
women of the Amazon race dwelt round the temple;<a id="noteref_1628" name="noteref_1628" href="#note_1628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1628</span></span></a>
although virgins only were permitted to enter the sanctuary
itself.<a id="noteref_1629" name="noteref_1629" href="#note_1629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1629</span></span></a> It appears therefore that the goddess
upon whom these Amazons attended, being represented
as a beneficent and nourishing deity, was likewise supposed
to have the attributes of war and destruction; a
double and opposite character, which we have traced in
other branches of the worship of Artemis. As to the
native country of the Amazons, who were supposed to
have founded this worship, it does not seem to have
been Phrygia, as they are stated in the Iliad to have
come from the east of the Sangarius, and to have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fought with the Phrygians.<a id="noteref_1630" name="noteref_1630" href="#note_1630"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1630</span></span></a> The Syrians, however,
bordered on that people: and Pindar, who says that
the Amazons led the Syrian army,<a id="noteref_1631" name="noteref_1631" href="#note_1631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1631</span></span></a> fully coincides with
those who fix their origin on the banks of the Thermodon,
Chadesius and Lycastus along the coast of
Themiscyra.<a id="noteref_1632" name="noteref_1632" href="#note_1632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1632</span></span></a> The striking agreement of several
authors in this statement, and its singular precision,
render it of double importance. And what country
could have been more probably the native place of the
Ephesian Artemis, as well as of the warlike Hierodulæ,
than Cappadocia; where there were, in the historical
age, large numbers of sacred slaves, both male
and female; where also there was an elementary religion,
with frantic rites, and the principal divinity was
at the same time a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bellona</span></span>
and a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magna Mater</span></span>?

This same oriental worship had also been in other
places adopted by the Greeks of Asia Minor. Among
these are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leucophryne</span></span>, who was worshipped in

the local worships), we must give up all attempt at
completeness, and rest satisfied with a narrower view.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To begin then with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Zeus</span></span>. It is remarkable that
there was no great establishment of the worship of this
god (except the Phrygian in Crete) in any Doric
country, but wherever it occurred was connected with
and subordinate to that of some other deity. The
worship at Olympia<a id="noteref_1643" name="noteref_1643" href="#note_1643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1643</span></span></a> appears to have been established
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the Achæans, who in other places (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, at Ægium)
consecrated temples to Zeus alone: the worship of
Zeus Hellanius at Ægina was introduced by the Hellenes
of Thessaly. But the whole of Argolis and also
Corinth were, from early times, under the protection
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Here</span></span>, the character of whose worship resembled
that of Zeus, although it was more pronounced. The
chief temple was twelve stadia from Mycenæ, and forty
from Argos, beyond the district of Prosymna;<a id="noteref_1644" name="noteref_1644" href="#note_1644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1644</span></span></a> its
service was performed by the most distinguished priestesses,
and celebrated by the first festivals and games,
being also one of the earliest nurseries of the art of
sculpture. It appears that Argos was the original
seat of the worship of Here, and that there it first received
its peculiar form and character: for the worship
of the Samian Here, as well as that at Sparta,<a id="noteref_1645" name="noteref_1645" href="#note_1645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1645</span></span></a> was
supposed to have been derived from Argos, which
statement is confirmed by the resemblance in the ceremonies;
and the same is true of the worship of the
same goddess at Epidaurus,<a id="noteref_1646" name="noteref_1646" href="#note_1646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1646</span></span></a> Ægina, and Byzantium.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
In the early mythology of Argos her name constantly
occurs; and the traditions concerning Io, so far as they
were native, are only fabulous expressions for the ideas
and feelings excited by this religion. Thus also the
Corinthian fables of Medea refer to the indigenous
worship of Here Acræa.<a id="noteref_1647" name="noteref_1647" href="#note_1647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1647</span></span></a> Hence the Corinthians introduced
into their colony of Corcyra, together with
the religion of Here,<a id="noteref_1648" name="noteref_1648" href="#note_1648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1648</span></span></a> the mythology and worship of
Medea.<a id="noteref_1649" name="noteref_1649" href="#note_1649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1649</span></span></a> The peculiarities of the worship of Here
must partly be looked for in the symbolical traditions
respecting Io and Medea, and other mythological
personages of the same description, and partly in the
various rites of the Samian festival. It was doubtless
founded on some elementary religion, as may be
plainly seen from the tradition that Zeus had on mount
Thornax in southern Argolis seduced Here in the
shape of a cuckoo (whose song was considered in
Greece as the prognostic of fertile rains in the spring).
The marriage with Zeus (called ἱερὸς γάμος) is always
a prominent feature in the worship of Here; she was
represented veiled, like a bride; and was carried, like
a bride, on a car, with other similar allusions.<a id="noteref_1650" name="noteref_1650" href="#note_1650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1650</span></span></a> At
Samos it was related that the statue of the goddess had
been once entirely covered with branches; and this, as
it appears, was also represented at festivals.<a id="noteref_1651" name="noteref_1651" href="#note_1651"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1651</span></span></a> The
Argive festival of Λέχερνα, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of the <span class="tei tei-q">“bed of twigs,”</span>

2. In Argolis also the worship of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Athene</span></span> was of
great antiquity, and enjoyed almost equal honours with
that of Here; her temple was on the height of Larissa:
and doubtless she had the same character and origin
as the Athene Chalciœcus of Sparta.<a id="noteref_1653" name="noteref_1653" href="#note_1653"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1653</span></span></a> Their names
were in both places nearly the same, as at Sparta she
was called Ὀπτιλέτις,<a id="noteref_1654" name="noteref_1654" href="#note_1654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1654</span></span></a> and in Argolis Ὀξυδέρκης, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
quick-sighted</span></span>;<a id="noteref_1655" name="noteref_1655" href="#note_1655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1655</span></span></a> and though in both places the
names were explained from historical events, it seems more
accurate to compare them with the title of Athene at
Athens and Sigeum, Γλαυκῶπις, and others of the
same kind. At Argos a large part of the heroic
mythology is associated with the worship of Athene:
for Acrisius was fabled to have been buried in her
temple on the citadel;<a id="noteref_1656" name="noteref_1656" href="#note_1656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1656</span></span></a> and since Ἀκρία was a title of
the goddess herself,<a id="noteref_1657" name="noteref_1657" href="#note_1657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1657</span></span></a> it appears to me that the name
Ἀκρίσιος may be satisfactorily explained in this manner:
especially as it is plain from an analysis of the
mythology of Acrisius, Perseus, and the Gorgons, that
it is entirely founded on symbols of Athene. Corinth
also had a part in these fables, as is clearly shown by
the figures of Pegasus, of the head of Medusa and
Athene herself upon the coins of this state and of its
colonies Leucadia, Anactorium, and Amphilochian
Argos.<a id="noteref_1658" name="noteref_1658" href="#note_1658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1658</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is also another branch of the worship of
Athene in the Doric states, viz., that which extended
from Lindus in Rhodes to Gela in Sicily, and from
thence to Agrigentum and Camarina.<a id="noteref_1659" name="noteref_1659" href="#note_1659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1659</span></span></a> In all these
places Athene was the protectress of the citadel and
the town, and was associated with Zeus Polieus (also
with Zeus Atabyrius.<a id="noteref_1660" name="noteref_1660" href="#note_1660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1660</span></span></a>) As to the ceremonies with
which she was honoured, we only know from Pindar
that at Rhodes they offered fireless sacrifices to her,
and that the ancient sculpture of Rhodes was connected
with her worship. That of Hierapytna in
Crete (the coins of which city have the Athenian
symbols of Athene) more resembled the Rhodian
worship, if what the envoys from Præsus stated at
Rhodes was correct, viz., that at Hierapytna the Corybantes
were called the offspring of the sun and of
Athene.<a id="noteref_1661" name="noteref_1661" href="#note_1661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1661</span></span></a>

3. Although the worship of these deities, and of
Here in particular, had probably been more prevalent
before than after the Doric invasion, the religion of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Demeter</span></span> was still more depressed. This worship
was nearly extirpated by the Dorians, a fact which we
know from Herodotus, who, in speaking of some rites
of Demeter Thesmophoria which were supposed to
have been founded by the daughters of Danaus, states
that when the Peloponnesians were driven out by the
Dorians, these rites were discontinued, and were only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
kept up by those Peloponnesians who remained
behind, and by the Arcadians.<a id="noteref_1662" name="noteref_1662" href="#note_1662"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1662</span></span></a> Consequently we meet
with few traces of the worship of Demeter in the chief
cities of the Doric name.<a id="noteref_1663" name="noteref_1663" href="#note_1663"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1663</span></span></a> Thus it appears that in
Argos the ceremonies in honour of this goddess were
on one side driven into the marshes of Lerna, and on
the other to the eastern extremity of the peninsula, inhabited
by the Dryopes. In the former of these two
places some mystical rites were long performed, and
in the latter the chief worship was that of the deities
of the earth and the infernal regions (χθόνιοι θεοί).
Some inscriptions found at Hermione, which besides
Demeter and Cora mention the name of Clymenus,<a id="noteref_1664" name="noteref_1664" href="#note_1664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1664</span></span></a>
an epithet of Pluto, agree well with the beginning of
the hymn which Lasus the Hermionean addressed to
the deities of his native city: <span class="tei tei-q">“I sing of Demeter
and the Melibœan Cora, the wife of Clymenus,
sounding the deep-toned Æolic harmony of hymns.”</span><a id="noteref_1665" name="noteref_1665" href="#note_1665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1665</span></span></a>
And that the Hermioneans considered the temple of
the earthly Demeter (which was connected with the
entrance of the infernal regions supposed to be at Hermione)
as the first in the city, is also evident from the
fact that the Asinæans, expelled from Argolis and resident
in Messenia, sent sacrifices and sacred missions from thence to
their national goddess at Hermione.<a id="noteref_1666" name="noteref_1666" href="#note_1666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1666</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In ancient times also a worship was prevalent at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Argos which we will designate by the name of the

and his son Erysichthon (from ἐρυσίβη, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">robigo</span></span>) belong
to an agricultural religion, which at the same time
refers to the infernal regions. The places where this
religion existed in ancient times are the Thessalian
plains of Dotium, Argos, and likewise Attica;<a id="noteref_1668" name="noteref_1668" href="#note_1668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1668</span></span></a> and
from the first-mentioned place it was transmitted to
the south-western coast of Asia Minor by an early
national connexion which is indicated in the account of
an ancient Pelasgic colony from Dotium to Cnidos,
Rhodes, and Syme;<a id="noteref_1669" name="noteref_1669" href="#note_1669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1669</span></span></a> and here it formed the basis
of the Triopian worship, on which were afterwards
founded the federative festivals of the six Doric cities.
In front of Triopium is the small island of Telos,
whence a single family joined the Lindian colony that
founded Gela in Sicily, and earned with it the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sacra
Triopia</span></span>. A member of this family named Telines
advanced this private worship of the infernal gods so
greatly that it was incorporated in the national religion,
and he was appointed to administer it as Hierophant;
it was from this person that Hiero the king of
Syracuse was descended.<a id="noteref_1670" name="noteref_1670" href="#note_1670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1670</span></span></a>

4. By this history of the colonial connexions, well
attested from without, and having great internal probability,
we have ascertained the origin of one of the
branches of the worship of Demeter in Sicily. Another
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was probably introduced by the clan of the
Emmenidæ,<a id="noteref_1671" name="noteref_1671" href="#note_1671"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1671</span></span></a>
which being originally of Theban origin
came into Sicily with the colony of Gela: for it was
probably owing to the traditions of this family alone
that Agrigentum, as well as ancient Thebes, was
called <span class="tei tei-q">“a gift from Zeus to Persephone at their nuptial
festival.”</span><a id="noteref_1672" name="noteref_1672" href="#note_1672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1672</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But from neither of these two sources can the celebrated
worship of Demeter at Syracuse and its colony
Enna (which in the eyes both of the inhabitants and
of the Romans had made Sicily the native country of
Ceres) be derived, since it differed in certain respects
from both the above-named worships.<a id="noteref_1673" name="noteref_1673" href="#note_1673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1673</span></span></a> From its importance
we may infer that it was one of the most
ancient religions of Syracuse, and established at the
first foundation of that town; and since of these some
came from Olympia,<a id="noteref_1674" name="noteref_1674" href="#note_1674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1674</span></span></a> but the larger part from
Corinth, and there is no reason for supposing that it was derived
from the former place, it must have been brought
over from the parent state. Now it is true that there
was at Corinth a temple of Demeter and Cora, the
priestesses of which also prophesied by means of
dreams;<a id="noteref_1675" name="noteref_1675" href="#note_1675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1675</span></span></a> but the worship of those goddesses was there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of far less importance than in Sicily, where its preponderance
may perhaps be accounted for by the fertility
of the soil, which enabled it to produce wheat,
while the Greeks had in their own country been accustomed
to eat barley, and therefore stimulated the
colonists to be especially thankful to the goddess of
corn. When, however, it is remembered that Megara
also had a large share in the colonising of Syracuse, it
will hardly be doubted that this state was the real
source from which the worship in question originated,
since Demeter was there an ancient national deity, and
was not disturbed in her sanctuary on the citadel of
Caria even by the Doric invaders.<a id="noteref_1676" name="noteref_1676" href="#note_1676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1676</span></span></a>

In Laconia also the worship of Demeter had been
preserved from ancient times, although it could not
have been much respected by the Dorians in Sparta.
For the Eleusinia of that country were chiefly celebrated
by the inhabitants of the ancient town of
Helos, who on certain days carried a wooden statue
of Cora to the Eleusinium on the heights of
Taygetus.<a id="noteref_1677" name="noteref_1677" href="#note_1677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1677</span></span></a> The Lacedæmonians had also adopted

earthly, from the Hermioneans, some of whose kinsmen
had settled in Messenia.<a id="noteref_1678" name="noteref_1678" href="#note_1678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1678</span></span></a>

particularly on the Corinthian isthmus; also at Trœzen

6. The worship of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dionysus</span></span> did not enjoy equal
honours among all the Dorians. It had indeed penetrated
as far as Sparta, where it had driven even the

prevailed;<a id="noteref_1693" name="noteref_1693" href="#note_1693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1693</span></span></a> and it was in this town that,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
according to Pindar,<a id="noteref_1694" name="noteref_1694" href="#note_1694"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1694</span></span></a> the dithyramb was first established,
although indeed under the direction of a
foreigner (Arion). In the Doric colonies of Magna
Græcia this worship preserved the same character of
irregularity and excess; the whole town of Tarentum
was (as Plato says) drunk at the festival of Bacchus.
The painted vases give a perfect representation of the
antics and masques of this ancient carnival.

7. In Corinth, however, and Sicyon, the worship
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Aphrodite</span></span> as well as of Dionysus was established.
It seems probable that the worship of that deity had
indeed a native origin in Greece, but that it had been
extended and modified by Phœnician settlers in some
of the maritime towns. The institution of the <span class="tei tei-q">“hospitable
damsels,”</span><a id="noteref_1695" name="noteref_1695" href="#note_1695"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1695</span></span></a> whom the goddess their mistress
herself ordered to be at the disposal of strangers,<a id="noteref_1696" name="noteref_1696" href="#note_1696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1696</span></span></a>
was undoubtedly of Asiatic origin, and unknown to
the ancient Greeks.<a id="noteref_1697" name="noteref_1697" href="#note_1697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1697</span></span></a> Sicyon, however, appears to
have derived the worship of these two deities from
Corinth, the coins of which city generally have a dove,<a id="noteref_1698" name="noteref_1698" href="#note_1698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1698</span></span></a>
and frequently also a head of Aphrodite of ancient
workmanship; and the native poetess Praxilla (452
B.C.) addressed Aphrodite as the mother of Dionysus,<a id="noteref_1699" name="noteref_1699" href="#note_1699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1699</span></span></a> and sang of the joys and woes of the Phœnician

maritime cities had a certain susceptibility, flexibleness,
and softness of character, the very contrary of all
these qualities distinguished the Spartans. For although
that state came into connexion with a Phœnician
establishment of the worship of Aphrodite in
the island of Cythera, they transformed it while they
adopted it, and had their own armed Aphrodite, and the
chained and veiled goddess of marriage.<a id="noteref_1701" name="noteref_1701" href="#note_1701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1701</span></span></a> From the

the name of Ciris.<a id="noteref_1702" name="noteref_1702" href="#note_1702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1702</span></span></a> Aphrodite, however, enjoyed
greater honours in the Spartan colony of Cnidos,
whence she went to Halicarnassus under the title of
Acræa, and from thence to the mother city Trœzen.<a id="noteref_1703" name="noteref_1703" href="#note_1703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1703</span></span></a>

that once flourishing city.<a id="noteref_1705" name="noteref_1705" href="#note_1705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1705</span></span></a>

The worship of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hermes</span></span> does not appear to have

8. We will just notice the worship of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Charites</span></span>
established in Crete and Sparta; first, as a
fresh proof of the early religious connexion between
those two countries,<a id="noteref_1711" name="noteref_1711" href="#note_1711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1711</span></span></a> and as a sign of that hilarity and
gladness which was the most beautiful feature of the
religion of the Greeks. These goddesses were at
Sparta called Cleta and Phaënna; their temple was
on the road from the city to Amyclæ, on the river
Tiasa.<a id="noteref_1712" name="noteref_1712" href="#note_1712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1712</span></span></a>
Allied to this was the worship of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eros</span></span>, as
practised by the Cretans and Spartans, with whom,
before every battle, the most beautiful men assembled
and sacrificed to that god:<a id="noteref_1713" name="noteref_1713" href="#note_1713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1713</span></span></a> not as the great

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most obscure, perhaps, of all the branches of
religion whose origin we have to investigate is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worship of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dioscuri</span></span>, or the sons of Zeus. It
appears probable that it had a double source, viz., the
heroic honours of the human Tyndaridæ, and the
ancient Peloponnesian worship of the great gods or
Cabiri; and in process of time the attributes of the
latter seem by poetry and tradition to have been transferred
to the former, viz., the name of the sons of
Zeus, the birth from an egg, and the egg-shaped caps,
the alternation of life and death, the dominion over
the winds and the waves. As belonging to their
worship at Sparta I may mention the ancient images
called δόκανα, two upright beams with two others laid
across them transversely;<a id="noteref_1715" name="noteref_1715" href="#note_1715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1715</span></span></a> the custom in military expeditions
of taking either one or both of the statues
of the Dioscuri according as one or both kings went
with the army;<a id="noteref_1716" name="noteref_1716" href="#note_1716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1716</span></span></a> which places the Tyndaridæ in the
light of gods of war; and the belief that they often
appeared as assistants in time of need, or even merely
as friendly guests,<a id="noteref_1717" name="noteref_1717" href="#note_1717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1717</span></span></a> which distinguishes them from most
other heroes. Upon the whole we know that the Dorians
found the worship and mythology of the Tyndaridæ
established at Amyclæ, Therapne, Pephnos, and
other places; and they adopted it, without caring to
preserve its original form and meaning; rather, indeed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attempting to give to the worship of the sons of
Tyndareus a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">military</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">political</span></em> reference.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Before we proceed to consider the heroic mythology
of the Dorians, which is chiefly confined to Hercules,
we will first attempt to sketch the principal
features of the religious character of the Dorians, as
seen in the several worships already enumerated.
Both in the development of modes of religion peculiar
to that race, and in the adoption and alteration of
those of other nations, an ideal tendency may be perceived,
which considered the deity not so much in
reference to the works or objects of nature, as of the
actions and thoughts of men. Consequently their
religion had little of mysticism, which belongs rather
to elementary worships; but the gods assume a more
human and heroic form, although not so much as
in the epic poetry. Hence the piety of the Doric
race had a peculiarly energetic character, as their notions
of the gods were clear, distinct, and personal;
and it was probably connected with a certain degree of
cheerfulness and confidence, equally removed from the
exuberance of enthusiasm and the gloominess of superstition.
Funeral ceremonies and festivals with
violent lamentations, as well as enthusiastic orgies,
were not suited to the character of the Dorians; although
their reverence for antiquity often induced
them to adopt such rites when already established.
On the other hand, we see displayed in their festivals
and religious usages a brightness and hilarity, which
made them think that the most pleasing sacrifice
which they could offer to their gods was to rejoice in
their sight, and use the various methods which the
arts afforded them of expressing their joy. With all
this, their worship bears the stamp of the greatest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
simplicity, and at the same time of warmth of heart.
The Spartans prayed the gods <span class="tei tei-q">“to give them what
was honourable and good;”</span><a id="noteref_1718" name="noteref_1718" href="#note_1718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1718</span></span></a> and although they did
not lead out any splendid processions, and were even
accused of offering scanty sacrifices, still Zeus Ammon
declared that the <span class="tei tei-q">“calm solemnity of the prayers of
the Spartans was dearer to him than all the sacrifices
of the Greeks.”</span><a id="noteref_1719" name="noteref_1719" href="#note_1719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1719</span></span></a> They likewise showed the
most faithful adherence to the usages handed down to
them from their ancestors, and hence they were little
inclined to the adoption of foreign ceremonies;<a id="noteref_1720" name="noteref_1720" href="#note_1720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1720</span></span></a> although
in commercial towns, as, for instance, at Corinth,

for strangers of other races and nations.<a id="noteref_1721" name="noteref_1721" href="#note_1721"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1721</span></span></a>

1. In the following attempt to unravel the complicated
mythology of Hercules, we will begin with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those fables in which this hero appears evidently as the
progenitor of the Doric Heraclidæ,<a id="noteref_1722" name="noteref_1722" href="#note_1722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1722</span></span></a> as representative
of the heroes of the Hyllean tribe, the highest order in
the Doric nation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will first direct our attention to the locality described
in the beginning of the first book, the ancient
country of the Dorians in the most mountainous part
of Thessaly, where this nation was continually at enmity
with its immediate neighbours, the Lapithæ. In this
war Hercules appears as the hero of the Hyllean tribe,
according to the epic poem Ægimius, and gained for
them a third part of the conquered territory. With
this contest is, as it appears, also connected the celebrated
conquest of Œchalia, the subject of an epic
poem called Οἰχαλίας ἅλωσις, which was ascribed to
Homer or Creophylus.<a id="noteref_1723" name="noteref_1723" href="#note_1723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1723</span></span></a> In this poem it was related
how Eurytus of Œchalia, the skilful archer, who was
said to have surpassed Hercules himself in this mode of
fighting, and who dared to engage with Apollo,<a id="noteref_1724" name="noteref_1724" href="#note_1724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1724</span></span></a>
promised his daughter Iole as a prize to the person
who should excel himself and his sons in archery; but
Hercules having accepted the challenge, Eurytus
refused to perform his engagement: upon which Hercules
collected an army, conquered Œchalia, killed
Eurytus and his sons, carried away Iole prisoner, and
gave her in marriage to his son Hyllus.<a id="noteref_1725" name="noteref_1725" href="#note_1725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1725</span></span></a>

The situation of this <span class="tei tei-q">“well-fortified”</span><a id="noteref_1726" name="noteref_1726" href="#note_1726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1726</span></span></a> Œchalia is
an ancient subject of controversy. There were three
places of this name; one on the banks of the Peneus
in Thessaly, in the ancient country of the Lapithæ,
between Pelinna to the east and Tricca to the west,
not far from Ithome:<a id="noteref_1727" name="noteref_1727" href="#note_1727"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1727</span></span></a> another in the island of Eubœa,
in the district of Eretria.<a id="noteref_1728" name="noteref_1728" href="#note_1728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1728</span></span></a> The third was a town in
Messenia, which in latter times was called Carnasium,
upon the boundary of Arcadia;<a id="noteref_1729" name="noteref_1729" href="#note_1729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1729</span></span></a> in which region there
was also a town named Ithome; and, as it is stated,
another named Tricca; so that we must suppose that
there was some early connexion between the inhabitants
of this district and the tribes near the Peneus.
Now it may be presumed that each of these Œchalias
was considered by the respective inhabitants as the
celebrated town of the great Eurytus; whence among
the early poets there was a difference of statement on
the subject. For the Messenian Œchalia is called the
city of Eurytus in the Homeric catalogue,<a id="noteref_1730" name="noteref_1730" href="#note_1730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1730</span></span></a> and in the
Odyssey,<a id="noteref_1731" name="noteref_1731" href="#note_1731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1731</span></span></a> which
statement was followed by Pherecydes;<a id="noteref_1732" name="noteref_1732" href="#note_1732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1732</span></span></a>
the Eubœan city was selected by the writer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the poem called the Taking of Œchalia;<a id="noteref_1733" name="noteref_1733" href="#note_1733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1733</span></span></a> as also probably in the
Ægimius,<a id="noteref_1734" name="noteref_1734" href="#note_1734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1734</span></span></a> and afterwards by Hecatæus
of Miletus;<a id="noteref_1735" name="noteref_1735" href="#note_1735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1735</span></span></a> the Thessalian, in another passage
in the catalogue of the ships, apparently of considerable
antiquity.<a id="noteref_1736" name="noteref_1736" href="#note_1736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1736</span></span></a> Since, then, this question cannot be
settled by authority, we can only infer (but with great
probability) from the connexion of the traditions that
the last-mentioned Œchalia was the city of the original
fable. The contest for this city is evidently closely
connected with the war with the Lapithæ; Eurytus,
as well as the Lapithæ, was hated by Apollo. If
Œchalia is placed on the banks of the Peneus, the
conquest of it naturally falls in with the other tradition;
if not, it stands isolated and unconnected. Again;
Hercules, according to all traditions, conquers Iole for
his son Hyllus; now Hyllus never occurs in mythology
except in connexion with the Dorians; consequently
the place of the battle must be looked for in the vicinity
of the Doric territory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even before the time of this war (according to the
common narration) Hercules had embroiled himself
with the Œchalians by killing Iphitus, the son of
Eurytus, who demanded of him the restitution of some
plundered cattle or horses. In the common version
of this story, Peloponnesus was the scene of the encounter;
for Hercules is said to have hurled him from
the walls of Tiryns.<a id="noteref_1737" name="noteref_1737" href="#note_1737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1737</span></span></a> But to expiate this murder, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the violation of the rights of hospitality, Hercules became
a slave; and, in order to release himself from the
guilt, he was compelled to pay to the father of Iphitus
his own ransom.

2. The meaning of this servitude cannot be rightly
explained without observing the remarkable coincidence
between some parts of the mythology of Hercules and
Apollo, which we will here shortly elucidate. As
Eurytus is represented sometimes as killed by Apollo,
sometimes by Hercules, so in the poem of the Shield
of Hercules<a id="noteref_1738" name="noteref_1738" href="#note_1738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1738</span></span></a> this hero punishes
Cycnus for profaning the Pagasæan temple; thus, in another tradition, he
slays Phylas and Laogoras, princes of the Dryopes, for
violating the shrine of Delphi and other temples;<a id="noteref_1739" name="noteref_1739" href="#note_1739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1739</span></span></a> and
consecrates the whole nation to the Pythian Apollo.<a id="noteref_1740" name="noteref_1740" href="#note_1740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1740</span></span></a>
Nor do I believe that Euripides invented the fable of
the restoration of Alcestis, and the contest between
Hercules and death.<a id="noteref_1741" name="noteref_1741" href="#note_1741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1741</span></span></a> It is also perhaps fair to infer,
from the legends of epic poets, in which Hercules is
represented as a hero in brazen armour, who defended
the sacred roads with his sword, and overthrew the
violent sons of Ares that waylaid the sacrificial processions
in the narrow passes and defiles, that in ancient
fables he was considered not only as the defender of the
Doric race, but also of the Doric worship.

We may now proceed to consider the sale and servitude
of Hercules; a point of primary importance in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the various forms which the legends concerning this
hero assume. In the present instance this degradation
originated from the killing of Iphitus. Here also the
parallel with the servitude of Apollo at Pheræ cannot
fail to strike every one. The god and the hero were
chosen, as examples, to impress the people in early
times with a strong sense of the sacred character, and
necessity of expiation for homicide.<a id="noteref_1742" name="noteref_1742" href="#note_1742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1742</span></span></a>
By whom Hercules
was supposed to have been purchased in the original
legend of northern Thessaly we know not; at a
later period Omphale was called his mistress, who
(according to Pherecydes)<a id="noteref_1743" name="noteref_1743" href="#note_1743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1743</span></span></a> bought him for three
talents.

3. We will now proceed to the second settlements
of the Dorians, which comprehend the towns between
the ridges of Œta and Parnassus; viz., Erineus, Cytinium,
Bœum, and Pindus.<a id="noteref_1744" name="noteref_1744" href="#note_1744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1744</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The neighbours of the Dorians in these settlements
were, as has been already stated, the Dryopes, the
Melians of Trachis, and the Ætolians. The first were
hostile to the Dorians; the other two were for the most
part friendly to them. These facts again are expressed
with much clearness in the mythology of Hercules.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Of the relation between the Dorians and Dryopians,
and the manner in which it is expressed in the fables
of Hercules, we have already given an account.<a id="noteref_1745" name="noteref_1745" href="#note_1745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1745</span></span></a> Ceyx,
the Trachinian, was a faithful friend of Hercules, and
of his descendants; in one account, indeed, he is called
the nephew of Hercules,<a id="noteref_1746" name="noteref_1746" href="#note_1746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1746</span></span></a> who is said to

marriage with Hercules is evidently a mythological
expression for the league which existed between the
Ætolian and Dorian nations before the invasion of
Peloponnesus.<a id="noteref_1749" name="noteref_1749" href="#note_1749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1749</span></span></a> For Deianira was an inhabitant of
Calydon;<a id="noteref_1750" name="noteref_1750" href="#note_1750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1750</span></span></a> and the Calydonians had the principal share
in this expedition. To this marriage is annexed a series
of connected Ætolian fables concerning Hercules. For
the peculiarity of this part of the heroic mythology is,
that they readily passed from one nation to another; and
wherever they obtained a firm ground, formed a large
mass of traditions. Among these is the conquest of
the bull Achelous,<a id="noteref_1751" name="noteref_1751" href="#note_1751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1751</span></span></a> and the adventure at the ford of
the Euenus,<a id="noteref_1752" name="noteref_1752" href="#note_1752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1752</span></span></a> which afterwards occasioned the death
of Hercules. It is also probable that the residence
of Hercules at Olenus, in the house of Dexamenus,
was connected with the Ætolian adventures; although
even Hesiod does not in this legend mention the ancient
Ætolian town Olenus in the neighbourhood of Calydon,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but the Achæan city of the same name on the banks of
the Pirus.<a id="noteref_1753" name="noteref_1753" href="#note_1753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1753</span></span></a> Now Dexamenus is frequently placed in
connexion with the Calydonian family of Œneus;<a id="noteref_1754" name="noteref_1754" href="#note_1754"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1754</span></span></a> the
wife of Œneus came from Olenus, and was of the same
family. The ancient legend represented him as a hospitable
hero: which quality is also expressed in his
name (Δεξαμενὸς, from δεξάμενος); in return for
which, Hercules released him from his brutal guests,
the Centaurs;<a id="noteref_1755" name="noteref_1755" href="#note_1755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1755</span></span></a> to which fable the ancient battle of the
Centaurs in the mythology of Hercules probably annexed
itself. Lastly, Hercules is said to have led the
Ætolians against the Thesprotians of Ephyra. This
expedition was perhaps as much celebrated in ancient
lays as the taking of Œchalia. Ephyra, which is here
spoken of, is an ancient city of Thesprotia,<a id="noteref_1756" name="noteref_1756" href="#note_1756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1756</span></span></a> situated on
the spot where the Acherusian lake flows into the sea
through the river Selleeis (Acheron). In later times
the name of this city was Cichyrus; but even at the
present day remains of the original Cyclopian style of
building, not unlike those of Tiryns, are extant.<a id="noteref_1757" name="noteref_1757" href="#note_1757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1757</span></span></a> The
whole district is celebrated in fables as the dwelling-place
of Aidoneus: as the seat of an oracle where departed
spirits were questioned, it was always regarded
by the inhabitants with an awe, which was further increased
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by a belief that the natives were very skilful in
the preparation of poison.<a id="noteref_1758" name="noteref_1758" href="#note_1758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1758</span></span></a> This city Hercules is said
to have attacked as an ally of the Ætolians; whence it
appears probable that this circumstance gave occasion
for introducing his contest with Hades, and his adventures
in the infernal regions, such as the carrying away
of Cerberus, the liberation of other heroes,<a id="noteref_1759" name="noteref_1759" href="#note_1759"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1759</span></span></a> &amp;c. It
must not, however, be thought, that in the style of
Euhemerus, I suppose a king Aidoneus to have really
once reigned in this district, who had a dog, or rather
a general, named Cerberus, whom Hercules overcame
in a battle, &amp;c. The following appears to be a more
probable method of accounting for the origin of this
fable. The gloomy religious rites on the banks of
the Acheron, which had always deterred the neighbouring
nations from a participation in them, were
at an early period contrasted with the free and active
habits of the heroic tribes; the awe inspired by the
presence of the unearthly spectres with the proud
spirit and bold thoughts of a military life. If now
the people themselves came into collision with each
other, their gods necessarily did the same; the result
of which was traditions of contest and war between
themselves. On the other hand, it must not be thought
that the fable has a purely symbolical meaning;
and that Hercules was worshipped, together with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hades, merely as an enemy of Death, as a deity
alleviating and removing the terrors of the infernal
regions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The rest of this fable, however, entirely loses its
symbolical character; viz., the manner in which the
birth of several Doric heroes is connected with the taking
of Ephyra; who, though out of the confines of
history, are nevertheless to be considered as real individuals.
In the first place, Hercules is stated to
have begotten Tlepolemus on Astyocheia, whom, according
to Homer, he carried away from Ephyra, on the river
Sellecis, after having destroyed many cities;<a id="noteref_1760" name="noteref_1760" href="#note_1760"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1760</span></span></a>
Antiphus and Pheidippus also were said to have come
from Ephyra in Thesprotia, the sons of Thessalus,
and grandsons of Hercules, to whom the noblest
families of Thessaly, as well as the Heraclidæ of Cos,
referred their origin;<a id="noteref_1761" name="noteref_1761" href="#note_1761"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1761</span></span></a> the latter, however, according
to another and later tradition, sprang from the union
of Hercules and the daughter of Eurypylus in Cos
itself.<a id="noteref_1762" name="noteref_1762" href="#note_1762"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1762</span></span></a>
The origin of this intricate fable appears to be
as follows: There were in the ancient country of the
Dorians some noble families which referred their origin
to the conquest of Ephyra; and these were designated
by the names of Tlepolemus, Antiphus, and Pheidippus;
those families went with the other Dorians to Peloponnesus,
and passed through Argos and Epidaurus
to Rhodes and Cos, where they partly new-modelled
their original family legends. Now it was always admitted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the Thessalian people came also from
Ephyra and Thesprotia; and when it settled among
the Greeks, and sought to participate in their traditions,
it was natural that Hercules, the conqueror of
Ephyra, should be placed at the head of its genealogies.

<a name="Book_II_Chapter_XI_Section_5" id="Book_II_Chapter_XI_Section_5" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
5. To the combat of Hercules and Pluto at Ephyra
we will now annex the legend of Geryoneus. The
cattle of Geryoneus and Pluto grazed together in the
island of Erytheia;<a id="noteref_1763" name="noteref_1763" href="#note_1763"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1763</span></span></a> but they were supposed to
belong to the Sun,<a id="noteref_1764" name="noteref_1764" href="#note_1764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1764</span></span></a> and therefore were of a bright red colour.
Now Erytheia was anciently believed to be near the
kingdom of Hades. For the statement of Hecatæus,
that Erytheia and Geryoneus belonged to Epirus and
the region of Ambracia,<a id="noteref_1765" name="noteref_1765" href="#note_1765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1765</span></span></a> could not have been owing to
an attempt to give to mythology an appearance of
reality: but he seems to have availed himself of some
real tradition. This is certain, from the datum of
Scylax, who would never have laid down Erytheia in
his Periplus<a id="noteref_1766" name="noteref_1766" href="#note_1766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1766</span></span></a> on the authority of a logographer.
According to this writer it is situated between the territory
of the Atintanes and the Ceraunian mountains,
north of Epirus, on the borders of Greece, at no great
distance from the earliest seats of the Dorians. Now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a name="Pg421" id="Pg421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it is a remarkable fact, that, even in historical times,
there were in the same country, viz., near the Aous, a
river running from mount Lacmon, herds sacred to the
Sun, which were guarded in the daytime on the banks
of that river, and in the night in a cave of the mountain,
by men whom the inhabitants of the Greek city of
Apollonia intrusted with this office as a particular
honour.<a id="noteref_1767" name="noteref_1767" href="#note_1767"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1767</span></span></a> It is not probable that the Corinthians, who
founded Apollonia, should have been the first to introduce
this usage, although there are traces of an ancient worship of
the Sun in the territory of Corinth;<a id="noteref_1768" name="noteref_1768" href="#note_1768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1768</span></span></a> but
we may fairly assume that the colonists merely retained
a native custom. This hypothesis clears away
all difficulty. The empire of Hades on this earth was
conterminous with a district in which the worship of
the Sun prevailed, and which contained innumerable
herds of cattle, under the protection of the god; but the
Greek hero, little caring for their sanctity, had driven
them away, and devoted them to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his own</span></em> gods. Epirus
was always distinguished for its excellent breed of
cattle, which were said to have sprung from the herds
of Geryoneus, which Hercules offered to the Dodonæan
Zeus.<a id="noteref_1769" name="noteref_1769" href="#note_1769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1769</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. We were led to these considerations by the
Ætolian legends respecting Hercules, from which we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will now return to the Dorians, who possessed the
mountainous tract along mount Œta towards Thermopylæ.
There was perhaps no region in the whole
of Greece which abounded more in local fables of Hercules.
It was in the pass of Thermopylæ that he
caught those strange monsters the Cercopes;<a id="noteref_1770" name="noteref_1770" href="#note_1770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1770</span></span></a> here
it was that Athene caused a hot spring to issue for him
from the ground;<a id="noteref_1771" name="noteref_1771" href="#note_1771"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1771</span></span></a> on the top of mount Œta, on the
Phrygian rock,<a id="noteref_1772" name="noteref_1772" href="#note_1772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1772</span></span></a> was raised the fatal pile, which the
brook of Dyras in vain strove to extinguish;<a id="noteref_1773" name="noteref_1773" href="#note_1773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1773</span></span></a> and many
adjacent cities claimed a connexion with his exploits:<a id="noteref_1774" name="noteref_1774" href="#note_1774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1774</span></span></a>
even the Ænianes (who at a later period settled in this
district) attempted to appropriate to themselves these
traditions;<a id="noteref_1775" name="noteref_1775" href="#note_1775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1775</span></span></a> and Heraclea Trachinia, not founded till
the Peloponnesian war, and the neighbouring Cylicrani,
were referred to the mythology of Hercules.<a id="noteref_1776" name="noteref_1776" href="#note_1776"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1776</span></span></a>
It is certain that local traditions of this kind must
have originated with the inhabitants of this district.
Is it at least probable that the natives of Argos would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg 423]</span><a name="Pg423" id="Pg423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have placed the death of their deified hero in a foreign
region, if they had been the original inventors of this
fiction? The career of the Doric hero doubtless closed
on the funeral pile of Œta; and this adventure ended a
series of fables, of which there are now extant only
some fragments. In this point of view we may perceive
a connexion between many of the legends detailed
above.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The general tendency and spirit of these legends
may be described in the following proposition: The
national hero is represented as everywhere preparing
the way for his people and their worship; and as protecting
them from other races. Thus he opens a communication
between Tempe and Delphi, between the
fabulous worshippers of Apollo, the Hyperboreans,
and the worshippers of his own age. At the same
time his own person is an outward symbol of the
national worship; he complies with its rites of expiation
for homicide, being himself both the victim and
the sacrificer.

<a name="Book_II_Chapter_XI_Section_7" id="Book_II_Chapter_XI_Section_7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
7. We will next consider the Theban legends of
Hercules; and will, for the sake of clearness, first
state the propositions which the following discussion is
intended to establish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hercules at Thebes is not to be considered as a
Cadmean; and has no connexion with the ancient gods,
and traditions of the Cadmeans; but his mythology
was introduced into Bœotia partly by the Doric Heraclidæ,
and partly from Delphi, together with the worship
of Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To prove that Hercules has no connexion with the
Cadmean gods, temples, and princes, it is only necessary
to refer to a genealogical table of the Theban
mythology, and a plan of Thebes sketched after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pausanias. From the former we perceive that Hercules
(whose father is represented as having arrived as
a fugitive from Mycenæ) is not made the relation either
by blood or marriage of the Cadmeans, Creon (κρέων,
the ruler), his supposed father-in-law, being only a
fictitious personage, invented to fill up a chasm in the
pedigree;<a id="noteref_1777" name="noteref_1777" href="#note_1777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1777</span></span></a> from the latter, that the temples of Hercules
were not only not in the citadel (like those of Cadmus,
Harmonia, and Semele), or within the walls of the
city, but were all without the gates. This fact is of
great importance as to the antiquity of any worship in
a city. The ancient and original deities, which enjoyed
the honours of founders, possessed the citadel as their
birthright; while all gods afterwards introduced enjoyed
a less honourable abode in the suburbs of the
town. Now it is known that the house of Amphitryon
and the Gymnasium of Hercules stood in front of the
gate of Electra, opposite the Ismenium;<a id="noteref_1778" name="noteref_1778" href="#note_1778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1778</span></span></a> and to this
we may add the account of Pherecydes<a id="noteref_1779" name="noteref_1779" href="#note_1779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1779</span></span></a>
respecting a village near that same gate, which the Heraclidæ had
founded before their invasion of Peloponnesus, and
where there was a statue of Hercules in the market-place.
What can be clearer than that these Heraclidæ
established the worship of their hero at Thebes?
Near this place (it should be observed) was the
Ismenian sanctuary of Apollo. Opposite to this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
temple Hercules was said to have been educated; and
at a festival of Apollo to have carried the laurel before
the chorus of virgins; and afterwards to have consecrated
a tripod in the temple, as was the general custom
in later times. This tripod is represented on the
famous relief of the Argive apotheosis of Hercules,
with the inscription Ἀμφιτρύων ὑπὲρ Ἀλκαίου τριπόδ
Ἀπόλλωνι.<a id="noteref_1780" name="noteref_1780" href="#note_1780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1780</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this is evidently connected the story of the
robbery of the Delphian tripod, of which the common
version is as follows: Hercules was visited with a severe
illness, as a punishment for the murder of Iphitus;
and, in consequence, he had recourse for relief to
Delphi; but as the Pythian priestess refused to answer
the questions of one guilty of homicide, he threatened
to plunder the temple, and carry off the tripod.
Apollo accordingly pursued him, till Zeus separated
the combat of his two sons by lightning.<a id="noteref_1781" name="noteref_1781" href="#note_1781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1781</span></span></a> The fable
went on to say that a new consecration of the Delphian
tripod took place, and a reconciliation of the god and
hero: of this part we are only informed by works of
art, these being indeed of tolerable antiquity.<a id="noteref_1782" name="noteref_1782" href="#note_1782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1782</span></span></a> But it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is manifest that this is not the genuine, ancient, and
sacred tradition. How could this hero, who in other
respects was entirely dependent on the mandates of the
oracle, and who in so many ways protected and promoted
the worship of Apollo,<a id="noteref_1783" name="noteref_1783" href="#note_1783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1783</span></span></a> suddenly become a
sacrilegious violator of his most holy and ancient
temple? This carrying away of the tripod appears
from other traditions to signify nothing else than a
propagation of the worship of Apollo.<a id="noteref_1784" name="noteref_1784" href="#note_1784"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1784</span></span></a> Whither,
then, is this tripod stated to have been first moved?
By the Arcadians Hercules was said to have brought
it to Pheneus, but was compelled again to restore it to
Apollo.<a id="noteref_1785" name="noteref_1785" href="#note_1785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1785</span></span></a> The hero, on his journey to Elis, is said to

however, can scarcely be more ancient than the Doric
migration. The foundation of this temple, as dependent
on the Delphic oracle, was therefore by the tradition
expressed under this image of the transportation
of the tripod, the bearer of it being Hercules. But it
is more important to our present purpose that, according
to the Bœotian account,<a id="noteref_1787" name="noteref_1787" href="#note_1787"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1787</span></span></a> Hercules was supposed
to have brought the tripod to Thebes, that is probably
to the Ismenium. This fable therefore shows the connexion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
between the Ismenium and the great sanctuary
of Apollo; and represents Hercules as the intermediate
link between these two temples.

8. Several other traditions current in Bœotia are
connected with the above explanation of this tradition.
The Cretan colony, which, setting out from Cirrha,
established the Tilphosian temple at Ocalea in Bœotia,
was represented under the person of Rhadamanthus.<a id="noteref_1788" name="noteref_1788" href="#note_1788"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1788</span></span></a>
Rhadamanthus is said to have there dwelt with Alcmene,
and to have instructed the youthful hero in the
Cretan art of archery.<a id="noteref_1789" name="noteref_1789" href="#note_1789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1789</span></span></a> For this reason also Zeus
raised Alcmene from the dead, and conducted her to
the islands of the blest as the wife of Rhadamanthus.
A stone remained in her tomb, which was set up in her
sacred grove at Thebes.<a id="noteref_1790" name="noteref_1790" href="#note_1790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1790</span></span></a>

9. The Theban traditions of Hercules are not all
equally significant; but some, such as those just mentioned,
had a religious, some a political<a id="noteref_1791" name="noteref_1791" href="#note_1791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1791</span></span></a> import, and
others only express the bodily strength of that hero.
The education of Hercules is confided to certain fabulous
personages, most of whom were supposed to
reside in Bœotia.<a id="noteref_1792" name="noteref_1792" href="#note_1792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1792</span></span></a> His most remarkable instructor
is the minstrel Linus, whom (probably in execution of
the will of Apollo) he put to death,<a id="noteref_1793" name="noteref_1793" href="#note_1793"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1793</span></span></a> justifying himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the law of Rhadamanthus. The destruction
of the lion of Cithæron is an imitation of the legend
of Nemea, of which we shall speak hereafter.<a id="noteref_1794" name="noteref_1794" href="#note_1794"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1794</span></span></a> After
this adventure he went to Thespiæ, to the house of
Thestius, where he deflowers in one or in fifty-seven
nights the fifty daughters of his host, a fable which
has perhaps an astronomical reference.<a id="noteref_1795" name="noteref_1795" href="#note_1795"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1795</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With respect to the singular legend of Hercules
murdering his children by Megara by throwing them
into the fire,<a id="noteref_1796" name="noteref_1796" href="#note_1796"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1796</span></span></a> it cannot be denied that this had some
symbolical meaning, derived from an ancient elementary
religion. In general, however, this temporary
fury is merely an exaggerated picture of that heroic
mind whose courage and endurance had carried Hercules
through so many dangers and difficulties for the
good of mankind.<a id="noteref_1797" name="noteref_1797" href="#note_1797"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1797</span></span></a> According to the Bœotian version,
it was a melancholy madness, in which Hercules,
regardless even of all that was most dear to him,
murdered his children, and was even on the point of
slaying his father.<a id="noteref_1798" name="noteref_1798" href="#note_1798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1798</span></span></a> Upon this the hero, oppressed
with a deep melancholy, turned for relief to the atoning
Apollo; and either to the god of the Ismenium<a id="noteref_1799" name="noteref_1799" href="#note_1799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1799</span></span></a> or
of Pytho.<a id="noteref_1800" name="noteref_1800" href="#note_1800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1800</span></span></a> The oracle commands him to serve as a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
slave, in the same manner as Apollo himself had
served after the destruction of the Python. In the
broken narrative of Apollodorus a remarkable trace
has been preserved as to the time during which, according
to the Bœotian tradition, the slavery of Hercules
lasted, viz., eight years and one month.<a id="noteref_1801" name="noteref_1801" href="#note_1801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1801</span></span></a> This
cannot be considered as an accidental number; but it
is probable that the Ennaëteris is signified, which was
a period of eight years and three intercalary months;
of which only the last month is here mentioned, because
the two inserted in the middle were less conspicuous.
Hercules, therefore, like Apollo at Pheræ,
was supposed to have served for an ἀΐδιος ἐνιαυτὸς, for
the octennial period of mythology and ancient astronomy.<a id="noteref_1802" name="noteref_1802" href="#note_1802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1802</span></span></a>

10. We will here add some observations on the
Attic worship of Hercules, which was celebrated
chiefly at Marathon in the Tetrapolis,<a id="noteref_1803" name="noteref_1803" href="#note_1803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1803</span></span></a> in the three
villages of Melite, Diomea, and Collytus,<a id="noteref_1804" name="noteref_1804" href="#note_1804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1804</span></span></a> which lay
close to one another in the vicinity of Athens; at Cynosarges<a id="noteref_1805" name="noteref_1805" href="#note_1805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1805</span></span></a>
in particular, which belonged to the demus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Diomea; at Acharnæ<a id="noteref_1806" name="noteref_1806" href="#note_1806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1806</span></span></a>
and Hephæstia,<a id="noteref_1807" name="noteref_1807" href="#note_1807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1807</span></span></a> and in the
city itself; and likewise near the sea in the Tetracomæ,
or <span class="tei tei-q">“Four Hamlets.”</span><a id="noteref_1808" name="noteref_1808" href="#note_1808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1808</span></span></a> The circumstance that
those temples which were not situated in the vicinity
of the city were all in the northern part of Attica,
seems to prove that the worship was derived from the
northern frontiers; and it was attributed to the presence
of the Heraclidæ in Attica, though the fable of
the great assistance which Athens lent to the Heraclidæ
was peculiar to the
Athenians.<a id="noteref_1809" name="noteref_1809" href="#note_1809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1809</span></span></a> It is probable,
however, that at some early period a division of the
Doric people passed through Attica, and there founded
that worship which, by the supremacy of the Dorians
and their various connexions with other nations, increased
in character and importance. If the Lacedæmonians
really spared the Tetrapolis in the Peloponnesian
war,<a id="noteref_1810" name="noteref_1810" href="#note_1810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1810</span></span></a> their forbearance must be attributed
to the respect which they showed to their national
hero. There is a tradition worthy of notice, that
Theseus consecrated to Hercules all the temples which
had been dedicated to himself;<a id="noteref_1811" name="noteref_1811" href="#note_1811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1811</span></span></a> whence it may be inferred
that the worship of the former demigod was
thus transferred at some early period; only not, it
should be observed, at the time of Theseus himself.
That the worship of Hercules was only half-nationalized
may (as it appears) be inferred from the custom
of the Parasiti of that hero at Cynosarges being always
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a name="Pg431" id="Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Athenians, of whose parents one only was a citizen;
a symbolical allusion to the half-foreign origin of their
worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the same description are the traditions which
were peculiar to the villages of Aphidna, Decelea,
and Titacidæ (likewise situated in the north of Attica),
respecting the expedition of the Tyndaridæ;
who were said to have conquered Aphidna with the
aid of Decelus and Titacus.<a id="noteref_1812" name="noteref_1812" href="#note_1812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1812</span></span></a> From this plunder,
according to a Spartan legend, the very ancient temple
of Pallas Chalciœcus at Sparta was built. In this
instance, likewise, the tradition was recognised as real
history; for the Lacedæmonians always kept up a
friendly intercourse with Decelea; nor was it, we
may be assured, without some particular reason that
in the Messenian war at the command of the oracle
they called to their aid Tyrtæus, the man of Aphidna.
But as the Tyndaridæ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, their images (as was mentioned
above),<a id="noteref_1813" name="noteref_1813" href="#note_1813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1813</span></span></a>
accompanied every Spartan army on
its marches, it is probable that these stories originated
in some Doric expedition into the northern parts of
Attica, which left behind it these permanent traces
and recollections.

1. We must now entreat the indulgence of our
readers when we enter upon an obscure and difficult
part of our subject, and one lying beyond the limits
of historical record. We allude to the Peloponnesian
mythology of Hercules; a collection of legends doubtless
for the most part invented subsequently to the
Doric invasion, and intended by that nation in great
measure to justify their conquest of the peninsula, and
to make their expedition appear, not as an act of
wrongful aggression, but as a re-assertion of ancient
right. Some hero (perhaps even of the same name)
must have existed in the Argive traditions in the time
of the Persidæ, and the resemblance may have been
sufficiently striking to identify him with the father of
the Doric Hyllus. We shall therefore consider the
destroyer of the Nemean lion as a native Argive hero;
but the delay experienced at his birth, and his consequent
exposure to want and toil, evidently belong to
the Doric tradition, as well as the enmity of Here;
fables which were partly borrowed from the worship
of Apollo, and may partly have been intended to indicate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the contrast between the ancient worship of Argos
and that of the invading race.<a id="noteref_1814" name="noteref_1814" href="#note_1814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1814</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall now proceed without further preface to
consider the different adventures of Hercules, which
may be divided into two classes; the first consisting
of his warlike exploits, the second of his combats
with wild beasts. We shall commence with the examination
of the latter.<a id="noteref_1815" name="noteref_1815" href="#note_1815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1815</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nemea was separated from the Argive temple of
Here, the most ancient one in the country, by a chain
of mountains and a long rocky ravine. It cannot be
denied that the moon was often invoked in this worship,
although it would not be safe to consider Here
as the goddess of the moon. Now Nemea is called
the daughter of the moon,<a id="noteref_1816" name="noteref_1816" href="#note_1816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1816</span></span></a> from which deity the Nemean
lion is also said to have sprung; the antiquity
of which fable may be inferred from the circumstance
that Anaxagoras availed himself of it, as being generally
received, to account for the physical hypothesis
of the Antichthon.<a id="noteref_1817" name="noteref_1817" href="#note_1817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1817</span></span></a> Connected with this is Hesiod's
tradition that the goddess Here had herself brought
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
up the lion, which she is by that poet represented as
having done out of enmity to Hercules. Hence we
detect the symbolical character of the fable, which
resembles that of Perseus and Gorgo, &amp;c.; although
we can scarcely attempt to explain the whole legend
in a similar manner. The combat with the Lernæan
hydra may also be thus explained. Hercules is represented
as employing in this contest the same sickle
with which Perseus beheaded Medusa.<a id="noteref_1818" name="noteref_1818" href="#note_1818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1818</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever meaning we may attach to these combats,
whether we consider them as symbolical, or as memorials
of a remote antiquity, in which it was the hero's
principal occupation to free Greece from monsters and
wild beasts, it is nevertheless evident that they are as
little adapted to the time assigned to them (shortly
previous to the Pelopidæ) as to the character of the
other parts of the fable. A mere consideration of
Hercules' costume will sufficiently convince us of this
fact. It is certain that the Hercules of the early
poets was either a hero armed with a spear and
buckler, as in the poem attributed to Hesiod,<a id="noteref_1819" name="noteref_1819" href="#note_1819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1819</span></span></a> or with
a bow and sword, as in the Odyssey.<a id="noteref_1820" name="noteref_1820" href="#note_1820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1820</span></span></a> The latter description
occurs particularly in the battle of the giants;
the former is founded on all the traditions which represent
Hercules as the first of warriors and conquerors.
Pisander and Stesichorus were the first who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
introduced him as a half-naked savage, with the lion's
skin round his loins, the jaws covering his head instead
of a helmet, and merely a club in his hand.<a id="noteref_1821" name="noteref_1821" href="#note_1821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1821</span></span></a>
There were extant so late as the time of Strabo some
ancient wooden statues of Hercules very different from
this description. Pisander, too, was (as far as we
know) the first who represented in detail the combats
of Hercules with wild beasts, collected from scattered
accounts in the Theogony, and who composed the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Labours of Hercules;”</span> for which he perhaps
availed himself of different local traditions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. We now come to the martial exploits of Hercules,
which, as it appears, were intended to represent
the conquests of the Dorians in Peloponnesus.
We have only to direct our attention to the account
that Hercules, towards the close of his life, being
prince of Mycenæ,<a id="noteref_1822" name="noteref_1822" href="#note_1822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1822</span></span></a>
delivered Sparta from the Hippocontidæ
into the hands of Tyndareus, and, after conquering
Pylos from Neleus, transferred, it to Nestor,<a id="noteref_1823" name="noteref_1823" href="#note_1823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1823</span></span></a>
in order to perceive the coincidence of tradition and
history. The circumstances which have chiefly contributed
to the formation of these traditions may best
be traced in the combat at Pylos. The share which
Hades had in this adventure, when that god was himself
wounded by the bold son of Zeus,<a id="noteref_1824" name="noteref_1824" href="#note_1824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1824</span></span></a> may be considered,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a name="Pg436" id="Pg436" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
according to the connexion established above,
as having been transferred from Ephyra, where Hades
had a greater inducement to the protection of oppressed
cities than at Pylos.<a id="noteref_1825" name="noteref_1825" href="#note_1825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1825</span></span></a> But Hercules is said
to have destroyed Pylos because Neleus would not
purify him from the murder of Iphitus;<a id="noteref_1826" name="noteref_1826" href="#note_1826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1826</span></span></a> an act
which Deiphobus afterwards performed in the temple
of Apollo at Amyclæ.<a id="noteref_1827" name="noteref_1827" href="#note_1827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1827</span></span></a> Here it seems to be assumed
that Œchalia, the native city of Iphitus, was situated
in Messenia, which, as we have shown
above,<a id="noteref_1828" name="noteref_1828" href="#note_1828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1828</span></span></a> was
not the original tradition.

<a name="Book_II_Chapter_XII_Section_3" id="Book_II_Chapter_XII_Section_3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
3. The influence of historical facts upon mythology
is most clearly perceivable in the legend of Hercules
having founded the Olympic games when he returned
victorious from his expedition against Augeas of
Elis.<a id="noteref_1829" name="noteref_1829" href="#note_1829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1829</span></span></a> Afterwards the same hero celebrates the first
Olympiad as a festival of all Peloponnesus, with
various combats, in which heroes from Tiryns, Tegea,
Mantinea, and Sparta were victorious.<a id="noteref_1830" name="noteref_1830" href="#note_1830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1830</span></span></a> It was also
Hercules who fixed the quinquennial period, and
established the sacred armistice.<a id="noteref_1831" name="noteref_1831" href="#note_1831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1831</span></span></a> His bringing
the wild olive-tree from the Hyperboreans, and planting it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the grove of Altis, was probably derived from the
traditions of Northern Greece;<a id="noteref_1832" name="noteref_1832" href="#note_1832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1832</span></span></a> in which Hercules
was represented as more closely connected with
Apollo than in the common Peloponnesian legends.
It should, moreover, be remarked that Hercules in his
expedition against Elis is reported to have founded or
visited several temples of Apollo at Pheneus and
Thelpusa;<a id="noteref_1833" name="noteref_1833" href="#note_1833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1833</span></span></a> both lying on the road which connected
the isthmus and the north of Greece with Olympia.<a id="noteref_1834" name="noteref_1834" href="#note_1834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1834</span></span></a> It would, however, involve us in no slight difficulties
to date the tradition of Hercules founding the Olympic
games later than the Olympiad of Iphitus; for
as since that period the Eleans conducted the festival,
and therefore showed a particular veneration for Hercules,
it is scarcely probable that a war <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against Elis</span></em>
should have been considered as the cause of the establishment
of this festival, had not the report been
handed down from an earlier period. The continual
claim of Pisa, that the presidency of the games should
be restored to her as an ancient right, is, however,
one of several circumstances which render it probable
that she had once enjoyed this privilege before the
festival had acquired its subsequent celebrity; and
that Hercules, to whom a very ancient wooden statue
had been erected at Pisa,<a id="noteref_1835" name="noteref_1835" href="#note_1835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1835</span></span></a> was, even at this early
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a name="Pg438" id="Pg438" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
period, regarded as the founder: to which facts the
story of a war against Elis was easily subjoined.
The combat with Augeas, a son of Helius, seems to
have been in great part borrowed from some Epirotan
fable respecting Geryon.

4. In tracing the various steps which led to the
formation of the Peloponnesian mythology of Hercules,
it has by no means been our aim to enter minutely
into the details of the subject, which would
carry us far beyond the limits of the present inquiry;
the distinction between the ancient and recent parts
of the tradition being so undefined that an accurate
separation of the two is almost impossible. Enough
has been said to show how frequently the same legend
reappears in different shapes; and consequently that
some original version was variously modified in different
places. We shall once for all remind those
who imagine the northern legend of Hercules to
have been of later date than the Peloponnesian because
the latter is mentioned by the early epic poets,
that some higher source must be sought for than a
few passages of those poets which have been accidentally
preserved: that it should be looked for (if anywhere)
in some connected mythological tradition, to
which the particular fables owed their rise and development.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The task is comparatively easy to examine the history
of fables, the scene of which lies in colonies or
countries with which the Greeks did not become acquainted
till a late period, as the events on which
they are founded took place within the era of our
historical knowledge. At the same time the analogy
of these facts, sufficiently ascertained, enables us to
conjecture as to those which are enveloped in fabulous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
obscurity; we can reason from what we know to what
we do not know.

5. From Sparta the worship of Hercules spread to
her colonies, particularly Tarentum<a id="noteref_1836" name="noteref_1836" href="#note_1836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1836</span></span></a> and Croton. In
the latter city Hercules enjoyed the honours of a
founder,<a id="noteref_1837" name="noteref_1837" href="#note_1837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1837</span></span></a> being reported to have established it on his
return from Erythea.<a id="noteref_1838" name="noteref_1838" href="#note_1838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1838</span></span></a> Afterwards the
tradition of his purification and atonement was transferred from
Amyclæ in Laconia to Croton, an event to which the
high reputation enjoyed by the worship of Apollo in
the latter town greatly contributed. Hence we perceive
on the coins of this place the youthful hero sitting
with a bow, quiver, and arrows before a blazing
altar, on which he scorches a branch of laurel.<a id="noteref_1839" name="noteref_1839" href="#note_1839"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1839</span></span></a> Connected
with the above is the tradition of Philoctetes
having deposited the arrows of Hercules in the temple
of Apollo Alæus at Croton, from whence they were
said to have been brought by the Crotoniats into the
temple of Apollo within the precincts of their
town.<a id="noteref_1840" name="noteref_1840" href="#note_1840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1840</span></span></a>
On the coins of that city Hercules is frequently seen
with a goblet in his hand, either in a recumbent or
erect posture. The allusion is explained by the following
story: Hercules, who was always thirsty, had
asked for some wine at Croton; but the woman of the
house dissuaded her husband from tapping the cask
for a stranger; on which account the women of that
country never drank wine.<a id="noteref_1841" name="noteref_1841" href="#note_1841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1841</span></span></a>

6. Our readers are, we take for granted, well acquainted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the fable of Hercules in the island of
Cos, as related by Homer.<a id="noteref_1842" name="noteref_1842" href="#note_1842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1842</span></span></a>
The events which contributed
to its formation are, in the first place, the
existence of several noble families of Heraclide descent,
whose origin, according to ancient traditions, was connected
with the conquest of Ephyra, though they were
afterwards said to have sprung from the supposed
residence of Hercules in the island itself, where the
ancestor of these families sprang from his connexion
with a daughter of the king of the Meropians. This
fiction of his abode in Cos took its rise in a mistaken
view of certain ceremonies there practised: for the
peculiarity of the worship in question, in which the
priest at the festival ἀντιμαχία, celebrated in the
spring, put on a female dress (as Hercules is said to
have disguised himself in woman's clothes,)<a id="noteref_1843" name="noteref_1843" href="#note_1843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1843</span></span></a> betrays
an Asiatic origin; which induced the poets of ancient
times to consider Hercules of Cos as identified with
the Idæan Dactyli.<a id="noteref_1844" name="noteref_1844" href="#note_1844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1844</span></span></a> This dress was also probably
worn in the Lydian worship of Sandon<a id="noteref_1845" name="noteref_1845" href="#note_1845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1845</span></span></a> (who was
called Hercules by the Greeks); for Omphale is said
to have attired the effeminate hero in a transparent
garment dyed with sandyx, a custom which evidently
originated in the practice of some festival. The man
described as the slave of a lascivious woman was a
symbolical representation of a soft and voluptuous elementary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
religion; while the same allegory was by the
Greeks referred to the servitude of Hercules in the
house of Eurystheus. This legend is first mentioned
by Pherecydes, then by Hellanicus of Lesbos (who
refers to the traditions current in the city of Acele),<a id="noteref_1846" name="noteref_1846" href="#note_1846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1846</span></span></a> and also in Herodotus, whose genealogy of the ancient
kings of Lydia—Hercules, Alcæus (from the Greek
mythology, Belus, the god of Babylon), Ninus (Nineveh),
Agron, &amp;c., refers to the Assyrian origin of the
ancient Lydian kings, and agrees remarkably with the
statement that Hercules-Sandon or Sandes, was originally
an Assyrian deity belonging to the same religious
system as Belus.<a id="noteref_1847" name="noteref_1847" href="#note_1847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1847</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. We now come to a fable of kindred origin, the
fable of Hylas. Hylas was invoked during midsummer
at the sides of fountains by the aboriginal inhabitants of
Bithynia,<a id="noteref_1848" name="noteref_1848" href="#note_1848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1848</span></span></a> long before the Greeks founded their city of
Cios; but the latter adopted the story of the boy falling
into the water, connecting it (as they worshipped Hercules
as their founder)<a id="noteref_1849" name="noteref_1849" href="#note_1849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1849</span></span></a> with the fable of that
hero. Indeed a legend very similar had previously existed,
the minion of Hercules being (according to Hellanicus)
Theiomenes, the son of Theiodamas the king of the
Dryopes.<a id="noteref_1850" name="noteref_1850" href="#note_1850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1850</span></span></a> The death of Lityerses was in Phrygia the
subject of an ancient song; and who else should have
slain him, according to the tradition of the Greeks, than
he whose power was dreaded throughout the countries
of the barbarians?<a id="noteref_1851" name="noteref_1851" href="#note_1851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1851</span></span></a>
The Greeks introduced such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name="Pg442" id="Pg442" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heterogeneous matter without hesitation into their mythology.
Hercules, even in the spot where his worship
originated, was represented as a hero of great power
abroad: he was the protector of boundaries and (if I
may be allowed the expression) of marches: afterwards,
when his worship was adopted by the whole of
Greece, he was considered as the general guardian of
the Grecian colonists. Thus he is represented as contending
for the territory of Heraclea on the Pontus,
against the aboriginal Bebryces, and in defence of
Cyrene against the native Libyans. For it seems very
probable that the combat with Antæus,<a id="noteref_1852" name="noteref_1852" href="#note_1852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1852</span></span></a> who derived
new vigour from touching the earth, was merely emblematical
of the contests sustained by the Greek colonists
against the Libyan hordes, which, though often conquered,
always sallied forth from the deserts in increased
numbers. Thus the fable of Hercules and
Busiris was invented at a time when the Greeks first
became known in Egypt, and had as yet only an imperfect
acquaintance with that country; for which
reason Herodotus ridicules it as a silly invention of the
Ionians. Busiris appears to me to have been the name
of the principal deity with the addition of the article.
In this story he is described as a ferocious tyrant, who
orders Hercules to be sacrificed, until the latter, recovering
himself suddenly, slays the tyrant and his
cowardly retinue.

8. While attempting to reconcile these discordant
traditions, and mould them into one connected story,
it was natural that the Greeks should find some affinity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a name="Pg443" id="Pg443" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of character between Hercules and the Phœnician god
Melcart, the son of Baal and Astarte (Ἀστερία). It
was to the existence of a temple of Hercules at Gadira
that the fable of this hero having there terminated his
voyage after the battle of Geryon, owed its origin; and
the neighbouring pillars of Hercules or Briareus<a id="noteref_1853" name="noteref_1853" href="#note_1853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1853</span></span></a> were
originally considered as the work of Melcart. The
Hercules of the Carthaginians was also represented as
a wanderer and conqueror;<a id="noteref_1854" name="noteref_1854" href="#note_1854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1854</span></span></a> his particular province was
the island of Sardinia;<a id="noteref_1855" name="noteref_1855" href="#note_1855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1855</span></span></a> which island became also

to have passed through Spain.<a id="noteref_1856" name="noteref_1856" href="#note_1856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1856</span></span></a> The discoverer of the purple dye, in

as the confusion soon became between the Doric and
Phœnician traditions respecting Hercules, they may
still be easily distinguished from each other; and the
first effect of their union may perhaps be traced in the
wish of Dorieus, the son of Anaxandridas, to found a
kingdom near mount Eryx, because Hercules had formerly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a name="Pg444" id="Pg444" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conquered that country;<a id="noteref_1859" name="noteref_1859" href="#note_1859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1859</span></span></a> now the worship and
name of the Phœnician Aphrodite (Astarte) existed
on mount Eryx, and probably also that of her son
Melcart.

9. Notwithstanding the long digression into which
the examination of our subject has led us, we are
afraid that the following positions, attempted to be
established as the result of the preceding investigation,
will by no means carry with them conviction
to all readers. We may, however, rest assured, that
whatever traces of an elementary religion can be
discovered in this fable, they were additions totally
at variance with its original structure. The fundamental
idea of all the heroic mythology may be pronounced
to be a proud consciousness of power innate
in man, by which he endeavours to place himself on
a level with the gods, not through the influence of
a mild and benign destiny, but by labour, misery, and
combats. The highest degree of human suffering
and courage is attributed to Hercules: his character
is as noble as could be conceived in those rude and
early times; but he is by no means represented as
free from the blemishes of human nature; on the
contrary, he is frequently subject to wild, ungovernable
passions, when the noble indignation and anger of
the suffering hero degenerate into phrensy.<a id="noteref_1860" name="noteref_1860" href="#note_1860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1860</span></span></a> Every
crime, however, is atoned for by some new suffering;
but nothing breaks his invincible courage, until, purified
from earthly corruption, he ascends mount Olympus,
and there receives the beauteous Hebe for his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg 445]</span><a name="Pg445" id="Pg445" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bride, while his shade threatens the frightened ghosts
in Hades.<a id="noteref_1861" name="noteref_1861" href="#note_1861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1861</span></span></a> As in the fable of Apollo, the godhead
descends into the circle of human life, so in Hercules
a purely human power is elevated to the gods. Hercules
also corresponds to the last-mentioned deity,
in his divine attributes, as an averter of evil (ἀλεξίκακος
and σωτὴρ);<a id="noteref_1862" name="noteref_1862" href="#note_1862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1862</span></span></a> which the Œtæans carried so far
as to worship him as the destroyer of grasshoppers
(κορνοπίων), and the Erythræans as the killer of the
vine-worm (ἰποκτόνος).<a id="noteref_1863" name="noteref_1863" href="#note_1863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1863</span></span></a> We cannot, however, agree
with Herodotus, who derives the deification of Hercules
from a combination of the Phœnician or Idæan
god, and the hero of Thebes, since Hercules also
enjoyed divine honours at places (as Messene and
Marathon<a id="noteref_1864" name="noteref_1864" href="#note_1864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1864</span></span></a>) where such an amalgamation can scarcely
be imagined. But he is a deity representing the
highest perfection of humanity, and therefore the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name="Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
model and aim of human imitation; and the summit
of heroic energy was seen where the human passed
into the divine nature. His life and actions on earth
are in ancient mythology perfectly human; and those
fables, which raise him above humanity, for instance,
those alluding to the combat with the giants,<a id="noteref_1865" name="noteref_1865" href="#note_1865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1865</span></span></a> betray a
later origin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. How little the ancient mythology was desirous
of divesting Hercules of any feelings of humanity may
be collected from various features in his character.
Hercules, whether invited or not invited, is a jovial
guest, and not backward in enjoying himself. This
explains the frequent allusions to him as a great eater
(βουθοίνας) and tippler, and also the Herculean goblets
and couches. The original source of all these
fictions was the ancient tradition of the residence of
Hercules with Ceyx and Dexamenus: nay, they
may be traced to the ceremonies observed at his
worship and festivals.<a id="noteref_1866" name="noteref_1866" href="#note_1866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1866</span></span></a> The Doric,<a id="noteref_1867" name="noteref_1867" href="#note_1867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1867</span></span></a> like the Athenian
comic poets and satirists, merely adopted the general
outline of the story, filling up the details to suit their
own fancy and humour: the latter adding some jokes
upon the gluttony of their Bœotian neighbours.<a id="noteref_1868" name="noteref_1868" href="#note_1868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1868</span></span></a> It
was Hercules, above all other heroes, whom mythology
endeavoured to place in ludicrous situations; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sometimes made the butt of the buffoonery of others.
This was the case in the fable of the Cercopes (treated
of in a ludicrous epic poem ascribed to Homer),<a id="noteref_1869" name="noteref_1869" href="#note_1869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1869</span></span></a>
who are represented as alternately amusing and annoying
the hero. In works of art they are often
represented as satyrs, who rob the hero of his quiver,
bow, and club.<a id="noteref_1870" name="noteref_1870" href="#note_1870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1870</span></span></a> Hercules, annoyed at their insults,
binds two of them to a pole, in the manner represented
on the bas-relief of Selinus,<a id="noteref_1871" name="noteref_1871" href="#note_1871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1871</span></span></a> and marches
off with his prize. Happily for the offenders, the
hinder parts of Hercules had become tanned by continued
labours and exposure to the atmosphere:
which reminded them of an old prophecy, warning
them to beware of a person of this complexion;<a id="noteref_1872" name="noteref_1872" href="#note_1872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1872</span></span></a> and
the coincidence caused them to burst out into an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a name="Pg448" id="Pg448" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
immoderate fit of laughter. This surprised Hercules,
who inquired the reason, and was himself so
diverted by it, that he set both his prisoners at liberty.
And in general no company better agrees with the
character of Hercules, even in his deified state, than
that of satyrs and other followers of Bacchus, as
might easily be proved by many works of Grecian
art. It also seems that mirth and buffoonery were
often combined with the festivals of Hercules: thus
there was at Athens a society of sixty men, who, on
the festival of the Diomean Hercules, attacked and
amused themselves and others with sallies of wit.<a id="noteref_1873" name="noteref_1873" href="#note_1873"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1873</span></span></a>
We shall hereafter show how these exhibitions originated
in the propensity of the Doric race to the
burlesque and comic.<a id="noteref_1874" name="noteref_1874" href="#note_1874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1874</span></span></a>

rivers is represented as very small.<a id="noteref_1878" name="noteref_1878" href="#note_1878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1878</span></span></a> It may be easily conceived
that this whole maritime district must have been low
and marshy; and by this means Pella, as Livy remarks, was
of all towns in the country best fitted for being the fortress
of the Macedonian kings, and the place of deposit for their
treasure, since it lay, like an island, in the morasses and
swamps formed by the neighbouring lakes and rivers. These
marshes were called by the expressive name of βόρβορος, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mud</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1879" name="noteref_1879" href="#note_1879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1879</span></span></a>

2. Although the mouths of these rivers were so near together,
the extent of mountains, valleys, and plains which
they encompassed in their course was very considerable,
amounting, according to modern maps, to 140 geographical
miles from north and south, and more than 60 from east to
west. The Axius, together with its minor branches, runs
from the great Scardian chain, which further on receives
the names of Orbelus, Scomius, and Hæmus; while the
course of the Haliacmon is close to the heights of mount
Olympus (part of which ridge in later times was called the
Cambunian mountains), and therefore to the borders of
Thessaly. Both ridges run at right angles from the great
mountain-chain which cuts the upper part of Greece in a
direction from north-west to south-east, its southern parts
bearing the name of Pindus, the ridge towards Thessaly and
Epirus of Lacmon,<a id="noteref_1880" name="noteref_1880" href="#note_1880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1880</span></span></a> and further to the north-west it is called
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

behind the whole of the district just named, and forms, as
it were, the spine, to which the mountains of Illyria, Epirus,
Macedonia, and Thessaly are attached like ribs. From this
chain the two lines of mountains proceed, which separate
the valleys of the Haliacmon and the Axius. The name of
the ridge between the Haliacmon and the Lydias is known by
the mention of mount Bermius above Berœa;<a id="noteref_1883" name="noteref_1883" href="#note_1883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1883</span></span></a> and Berœa
is certainly the modern Veria, or Cara Veria,<a id="noteref_1884" name="noteref_1884" href="#note_1884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1884</span></span></a> near the
northern bank of the Haliacmon. It will be shown presently
that Dysorum was the name of the mountain which
divided the Lydias and the Axius.<a id="noteref_1885" name="noteref_1885" href="#note_1885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1885</span></span></a> And the ridge, which,

valley of the Axius from the plains to the east, was called
(in one point at least), as we know from Thucydides'<a id="noteref_1886" name="noteref_1886" href="#note_1886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1886</span></span></a>

3. The valleys beyond the last-mentioned ridge are those
of the Strymon and the Angites. As the Axius falls into
the sea in a gulf to the west, so does the Strymon join the
sea to the east of the Chalcidian peninsula. Not far from
its mouth the Strymon forms a lake, into which the Angites
runs; a stream of considerable size, its course lying westward
of the Strymon. For that the eastern stream is the
ancient Strymon (notwithstanding the opinion of most modern
geographers) is, in the first place, evident from its
size; secondly, from the name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Struma</span></span>, which it now bears;
and, thirdly, from the statement of Herodotus,<a id="noteref_1887" name="noteref_1887" href="#note_1887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1887</span></span></a> that the
district of Phyllis reached southwards to the Strymon, and
westward to the Angites; it lay, therefore, above the confluence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the two rivers and the lake which they formed
by their junction. The ridge which lies to the east of the
Strymon was called, at least where it widens along the coast,
Pangæum.<a id="noteref_1888" name="noteref_1888" href="#note_1888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1888</span></span></a>

4. We will now chiefly follow the full and accurate accounts
of Herodotus respecting the districts situated near
the mouths of the three rivers just mentioned. First, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mygdonia</span></span>,
on the Thermaic bay, and round the ancient city of
Therma, extended, according to Herodotus, to the Axius,
which divided this district from Bottiaïs;<a id="noteref_1889" name="noteref_1889" href="#note_1889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1889</span></span></a> and it agrees
with this statement that the small river Echeidorus (probably
the modern <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gallico</span></span>), which fell into the sea at the marshes
near the Axius, in the lower part of its course passed
through Mygdonia.<a id="noteref_1890" name="noteref_1890" href="#note_1890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1890</span></span></a> To the east this district
extended still further; lake Bolbe, beyond Chalcidice, was either in
or near Mygdonia.<a id="noteref_1891" name="noteref_1891" href="#note_1891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1891</span></span></a> Thucydides, indeed, makes Mygdonia

reconciled with the account of Herodotus (who appears to have possessed
a very accurate knowledge of this region), that both
the maritime district, west from the Strymon, in which was
the Greek city of Argilus, and the land further to the interior,
was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Bisaltia</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1893" name="noteref_1893" href="#note_1893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1893</span></span></a> On the other side, above Mygdonia,
was situated (according to Herodotus) the district of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Crestonica</span></span>, from which the river Echeidorus flowed down
to the coast.<a id="noteref_1894" name="noteref_1894" href="#note_1894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1894</span></span></a>

5. Beyond the Axius, to the west of the stream, immediately
after Mygdonia, came <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Bottiais</span></span>, which district was

position and some ruins. According to

river Axius made the boundary of Bottiæa, and divided it
from the district of Amphaxitis, which was the name of the
opposite and more elevated side of the Axius.<a id="noteref_1900" name="noteref_1900" href="#note_1900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1900</span></span></a> Thucydides

same channel.”</span> Further on in the interior the Lydias
alone must have been the boundary of Bottiaïs, since otherwise
this district would not end in a narrow strip of land;
Macedonis, therefore, began on the western bank of the
Lydias. In this place nothing more can be said as to the
meaning of the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macedonis</span></span>, before the precise signification

it to begin just at the rise of mount Olympus, and
divides the narrow plain on the sea-coast from the tracts to
the interior. The southern boundary of Pieria is stated by

land, stretching towards Tempe, which belonged neither to
Pieria nor Thessaly. The chief place in Pieria was Pydna,

later times Citron (according to the epitomizer of
Strabo),<a id="noteref_1911" name="noteref_1911" href="#note_1911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1911</span></span></a>

8. Now that we proceed from the divisions of the coast
to the interior, we are deserted, indeed, by the excellent account

12. The subject of this dissertation made it necessary for
us to enter into the above detail as to the several provinces
and divisions of Upper and Lower Macedonia. We must
now proceed to inquire into the gradual extension of the
kingdom of Macedon; an investigation in which we are fortunately
assisted by the clear and accurate account of Thucydides,
who lived at no great distance from the country
which he describes; and whose words I now transcribe as
follows (II. 99.):

kingdom of Macedonia, extending along the sea,<a id="noteref_1953" name="noteref_1953" href="#note_1953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1953</span></span></a> was
first occupied by Alexander the father of Perdiccas, and
his ancestors of the family of Temenus, who came originally
from Argos; and ruled over it, having by force of
arms expelled the Pierians from Pieria,<a id="noteref_1954" name="noteref_1954" href="#note_1954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1954</span></span></a> and the Bottiæans
from the district called Bottiæa. They also obtained
in Pæonia a narrow tongue of land, extending
along the river Axius down to Pella and the sea: and on
the further side of the Axius they possess the district
called Mygdonia, as far as the Strymon, of which they
dispossessed the Edones. They also dislodged the Eordians
from the country still called Eordia, and from Almopia
the Almopians. These Macedonians also subdued
those other nations which they now possess; viz., Anthemus,
together with Crestonia and Bisaltia, and a large
part of the Macedonians themselves. The whole of this
country together is called Macedonia; and Perdiccas,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg 462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the son of Alexander, was king of it when Sitalces made
his invasion.”</span>

by those who have written on the growth and size of Macedonia;
and therefore it will be convenient to set down some
of the chief inferences which may be drawn from it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place, it is plain that the Macedonians, who
made the conquest, and founded the kingdom of Macedon,
were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not the whole Macedonian nation</span></em>, but only a part of
it. There were in the mountainous districts Macedonian
tribes, which had their own kings, and originally were not
subject to the Temenidæ. These are the Macedonian highlanders
of Herodotus,<a id="noteref_1955" name="noteref_1955" href="#note_1955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1955</span></span></a> from whose district the

as has been already remarked, in Elimeia.<a id="noteref_1957" name="noteref_1957" href="#note_1957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1957</span></span></a> The Elimiots were, according to
Thucydides, one portion of these Macedonians, the Lyncestæ
another; both which appellations were merely local,
and the full title was <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Macedonians in Lyncus</span></span>,”</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">“the Macedonian Lyncestæ.”</span><a id="noteref_1958" name="noteref_1958" href="#note_1958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1958</span></span></a> Of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">remaining</span></em> Macedonian

with any certainty be considered as Macedonians.

14. The name of Macedonia was not therefore, as some
have supposed, confined to the royal dynasty of Edessa,
but was a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">national appellation</span></em>; so much so, that it is even
stated that those very kings subdued, among other nations,
a large portion of the Macedonians. The tribes of Upper
Macedonia were long governed by their own princes; thus
Antiochus was king of the Orestæ at the beginning of the
Peloponnesian war;<a id="noteref_1960" name="noteref_1960" href="#note_1960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1960</span></span></a> the Lyncestæ were under the rule of
Arrhibæus, the son of Bromerus,<a id="noteref_1961" name="noteref_1961" href="#note_1961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1961</span></span></a> the great
grandfather, by the mother's side, of Philip of Macedon, who derived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a name="Pg463" id="Pg463" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his descent (not altogether without probability) from the
Bacchiadæ, the ancient rulers of Corinth;<a id="noteref_1962" name="noteref_1962" href="#note_1962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1962</span></span></a> and these
kings, though properly recognising the supremacy of the Temenidæ,
were nevertheless at times their nearest, and therefore
most dangerous, enemies.<a id="noteref_1963" name="noteref_1963" href="#note_1963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1963</span></span></a>

15. The Macedonian kingdom of the Temenidæ, on the
other hand, began from a single point of the Macedonian
territory, concerning the position of which there are various
traditions. According to Herodotus, three brothers of the
family of Temenus, Gauanes, Aëropus, and Perdiccas, fled
from Argos to Illyria, from thence passed on to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lebæa</span></span> in
Upper Macedonia, and served the king of the country (who
was therefore a Macedonian) as shepherds. From this place
they again fled, and dwelt in another part of Macedonia,
near the gardens of Midas, in mount Bermius (near <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Berœa</span></span>),
from which place they subdued the neighbouring
country.<a id="noteref_1964" name="noteref_1964" href="#note_1964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1964</span></span></a> Thucydides so far recognises
this tradition, that he likewise considers Perdiccas as the founder of the kingdom,
reckoning eight kings down to Archelaus.<a id="noteref_1965" name="noteref_1965" href="#note_1965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1965</span></span></a> The
other account, however, that there were three kings before
Perdiccas, is unquestionably not the mere invention of later
historians, but was derived, as well as the other, from some
local tradition. According to this account the Macedonian
kingdom began at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edessa</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1966" name="noteref_1966" href="#note_1966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1966</span></span></a> which had been taken by Caranus,
of the family of the Temenidæ, and by him named
after a goatherd, who rendered him assistance, Ægæ (or
Ægeæ).<a id="noteref_1967" name="noteref_1967" href="#note_1967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1967</span></span></a> Both narrations have equally a traditional
character, and were doubtless of Macedonian origin, only that
the latter appears to have been combined with an Argive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464" id="Pg464" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
legend of a brother of the powerful Phido having gone to
the north. The claim of Edessa is also confirmed by the
fact, that, even when it had long ceased to be the royal residence,
it still continued the burial-place of the kings of
Temenus' race, and, as Diodorus says, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hearth</span></em> of their
empire.<a id="noteref_1968" name="noteref_1968" href="#note_1968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1968</span></span></a>

<a name="Appendix_I_Section_16" id="Appendix_I_Section_16" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
16. Edessa and the gardens of Midas were both situated
between the Lydias and the Haliacmon, in the original and
proper country of Macedonia, according to the account of
Herodotus.<a id="noteref_1969" name="noteref_1969" href="#note_1969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1969</span></span></a> The manner in which the dominions
of the Temenidæ were extended along the sea-coast, and towards
the interior, we learn from Thucydides, who comprises in
one general view all the conquests of these princes until the
reign of Alexander. For to suppose that Alexander, the
son of Amyntas, made <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> these conquests, is an error which
is even refuted by the words of Thucydides; although it is
very possible that this prince, who began his reign about
488 B.C., at the time of the Persian power, and was the
brother-in-law of a Persian general,<a id="noteref_1970" name="noteref_1970" href="#note_1970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1970</span></span></a> added considerably to
the territory which he had inherited.<a id="noteref_1971" name="noteref_1971" href="#note_1971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1971</span></span></a> But when Xerxes
undertook his great expedition against Greece, the power of
Macedon was as great as it is described by Thucydides; nor
was its territory much enlarged during the interval between
the Persian and Peloponnesian wars.<a id="noteref_1972" name="noteref_1972" href="#note_1972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1972</span></span></a> For at the time of
the Persian war (481 B.C.) the Pierians were already
settled in New Pieria, especially in the fortified towns of
Phagres and Pergamus, at the foot of mount Pangæum,<a id="noteref_1973" name="noteref_1973" href="#note_1973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1973</span></span></a>
whither they retired, after having been driven out of Old
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pieria by the Macedonian kings;<a id="noteref_1974" name="noteref_1974" href="#note_1974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1974</span></span></a> in fact, this
extension of the territory of Macedon must have taken place at an early
period.<a id="noteref_1975" name="noteref_1975" href="#note_1975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1975</span></span></a> Moreover, Olynthus was, according to Herodotus,<a id="noteref_1976" name="noteref_1976" href="#note_1976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1976</span></span></a>
at least <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> 480 B.C., in the hands of the Bottiæans, who
had, as we learn from both Herodotus and Thucydides,
expelled the Macedonians from the ancient Bottiaïs; consequently
this district had been under the rule of the Macedonians
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> the expedition of Xerxes. Thirdly, Amyntas
the Macedonian, in 510 B.C., offered Anthemus in Chalcidice
to the Pisistratidæ;<a id="noteref_1977" name="noteref_1977" href="#note_1977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1977</span></span></a> the same argument therefore
applies in this case also. Anthemus, however, could hardly
have been obtained without Mygdonia: and that this district
was then a part of the Macedonian dominions is probable
also from the following reasons.<a id="noteref_1978" name="noteref_1978" href="#note_1978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1978</span></span></a> According to Thucydides,
the Macedonians drove out the nation of the Edonians<a id="noteref_1979" name="noteref_1979" href="#note_1979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1979</span></span></a> from
Mygdonia, between the rivers Axius and Strymon; and
accordingly we find the Edonians always mentioned as
dwelling to the east of the Strymon, at the foot of mount
Pangæum. Now Ennea Hodoi, situated on the eastern
bank of the Strymon, was, according to Herodotus,<a id="noteref_1980" name="noteref_1980" href="#note_1980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1980</span></span></a> in
the possession of the Edonians in the year 481 B.C.; and
Myrcinus, in the same region, was found by Histiæus, when
he visited it, to be an Edonian district,<a id="noteref_1981" name="noteref_1981" href="#note_1981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1981</span></span></a> as
it was at a later period by Brasidas.<a id="noteref_1982" name="noteref_1982" href="#note_1982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1982</span></span></a>
The latter argument is not indeed of
itself decisive, as it might be said that the Edonians were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg 466]</span><a name="Pg466" id="Pg466" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only driven together by the conquests of the Macedonians,
and had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">previously</span></em> been in possession of the further side of
the Strymon; but when combined with the former facts, it
offers an almost certain proof that the whole country, from
lake Bolbè to within a short distance from the Peneus, was
subject to the Macedonians before the expedition of Xerxes.<a id="noteref_1983" name="noteref_1983" href="#note_1983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1983</span></span></a>

series of Macedonian possessions; this Eretrian colony had
been, about 746 B.C.,<a id="noteref_1985" name="noteref_1985" href="#note_1985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1985</span></span></a> together with the
numerous Eubœan settlements in Chalcidice,<a id="noteref_1986" name="noteref_1986" href="#note_1986"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1986</span></span></a> at a period when the power of
the Macedonians on this line of coast was very insignificant;
and it preserved its independence until the reign of Philip
the son of Amyntas.<a id="noteref_1987" name="noteref_1987" href="#note_1987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1987</span></span></a>

17. From the facts now ascertained, we may deduce a
result of some importance with regard to the language of
Herodotus. This historian clearly and precisely distinguishes
between Bottiaïs and Macedonia in the time of
Xerxes,<a id="noteref_1988" name="noteref_1988" href="#note_1988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1988</span></span></a> although it is certain that Bottiaïs was then in the
power of the Macedonians;<a id="noteref_1989" name="noteref_1989" href="#note_1989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1989</span></span></a>
Macedonia he classes as a district
with Bottiaïs, Mygdonia, and Pieria. He uses the
word, therefore, not in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">political</span></em>, but in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">national</span></em> sense;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, he restricts it to the territory originally possessed by
the Macedonian nation, not applying it to countries which
had been obtained by conquest or political preponderance.
The Macedonia of Herodotus is consequently the territory

It extended, according to Herodotus, in a narrow tongue
down to the sea;<a id="noteref_1990" name="noteref_1990" href="#note_1990"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1990</span></span></a> a fact disregarded by Thucydides, when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467">[pg 467]</span><a name="Pg467" id="Pg467" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he states that the coast of Lower Macedonia was first reduced
by the Temenidæ.<a id="noteref_1991" name="noteref_1991" href="#note_1991"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1991</span></span></a>
Further from the sea, however,
the ancient Macedonia had a much wider extent, and included
the districts of Edessa and Berœa, Lyncestis, Orestis,
and Elimeia: for Macedonia is stated by Herodotus to have
been on the one side bounded by mount Olympus (which
ridge, where it borders on Pieria,<a id="noteref_1992" name="noteref_1992" href="#note_1992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1992</span></span></a> was called the Macedonian
mountains),<a id="noteref_1993" name="noteref_1993" href="#note_1993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1993</span></span></a> and on the other by mount Dysorum.
This last fact is evident from the statement of the same
writer, that a very short way led from the Prasian lake to
Macedonia, passing first to the mine from which Alexander
obtained an immense supply of precious metal; and then,
that having crossed mount Dysorum, you were in Macedonia;<a id="noteref_1994" name="noteref_1994" href="#note_1994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1994</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, evidently in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">original</span></em> Macedonia, since he
expressly excludes from it the mine which had been a subsequent
accession. The Prasian lake was in Pæonia;<a id="noteref_1995" name="noteref_1995" href="#note_1995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1995</span></span></a> but

can only be looked for to the north of Edessa and to
the west of the Axius, Macedonia Proper not extending so
far as that river. In this manner it is placed in the accompanying
map; in which also the ancient boundaries of the
Macedonian race are laid down according to the results
obtained by these researches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
18. On the other conquests of the Macedonians little need
be said. The occupation of Bisaltia and Crestonica was
subsequent to the expedition of Xerxes. The Thracian
king of these districts fled away,<a id="noteref_1997" name="noteref_1997" href="#note_1997"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1997</span></span></a> and left his kingdom a
prey to the ambition of Alexander, who thus extended his
empire to the mouth of the Strymon, which was the boundary
of Macedonia in the days of Thucydides and of Scylax, and
remained so until the time of Philip. At what time the
Macedonian kings reduced that part of Pæonia which
stretched along the Axius, Eordæa, Almopia, and a large
part of the Macedonians themselves, we are nowhere informed;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and to infer from Thucydides that these conquests
succeeded that of Mygdonia and preceded that of Anthemus,
would be laying too much weight upon the order in
which he arranges the events; in which, although he doubtless
paid some regard to chronology, the context required
that the conquests on the coast should be mentioned before
those of the interior. Eordæa was probably subjugated at
a very early period, since it lay, as it were, in a bay of the
Macedonian territory; and a very credible tradition has been
preserved by Dexippus,<a id="noteref_1998" name="noteref_1998" href="#note_1998"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1998</span></span></a> that Caranus had in early times
made an alliance with the Orestæ against the Eordians, and
founded his kingdom by the subjugation of that nation. In
fact, the first nation with whom the king of Edessa had to
contend was these Eordians. They were, according to
Thucydides, nearly annihilated by a war of extermination;
a small number of them escaped to Physca in Mygdonia;<a id="noteref_1999" name="noteref_1999" href="#note_1999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1999</span></span></a>
which district therefore was not as yet under the power of
the Macedonians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
19. Among those parts of Macedonia Proper which were
reduced by the Temenidæ, Elimeia may be particularly
mentioned, as is evident from the following circumstances.
Perdiccas, the son of Alexander, was at war with his brother
Philip, with whom he was to have divided his
kingdom,<a id="noteref_2000" name="noteref_2000" href="#note_2000"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2000</span></span></a> and
also with Derdas.<a id="noteref_2001" name="noteref_2001" href="#note_2001"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2001</span></span></a> The brothers of Derdas, before the
beginning of the Peloponnesian war, in alliance with the
Athenians, made a descent from the highlands, that is, from
one of the districts Elimeia, Orestis, or Lyncus, into the
dominions of Perdiccas.<a id="noteref_2002" name="noteref_2002" href="#note_2002"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2002</span></span></a> Now
Derdas<a id="noteref_2003" name="noteref_2003" href="#note_2003"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2003</span></span></a> was the son of
Arrhibæus, and cousin of Perdiccas; and it is plain that the
Temenidæ reduced Elimeia; and a branch of the same
family received this district as their peculiar
possession.<a id="noteref_2004" name="noteref_2004" href="#note_2004"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2004</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg 469]</span><a name="Pg469" id="Pg469" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
A separate king of Elimeia also existed in the time of
Archelaus,<a id="noteref_2005" name="noteref_2005" href="#note_2005"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2005</span></span></a> who doubtless belonged to the
same family. For a later Derdas occurs as prince of the Elimiots in the
time of Agesilaus,<a id="noteref_2006" name="noteref_2006" href="#note_2006"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2006</span></span></a> who perhaps was the same
as, or rather was the father of, the Derdas, whose sister Phila Philip
married.<a id="noteref_2007" name="noteref_2007" href="#note_2007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2007</span></span></a> In like manner, there was a separate sovereignty
in Stymphæa and the neighbouring Æthicia, which was
held by the family of Polysperchon, the general and
guardian of the kingdom.<a id="noteref_2008" name="noteref_2008" href="#note_2008"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2008</span></span></a> Although in later times all these
separate sovereignties, both of the Temenidæ and of other
princes, were suppressed, and Upper and Lower Macedonia
were equally ruled from the city of Pella; yet the tribes of
the highlands still remained to a certain degree distinct.
Even at the battle of Arbela, the Elimiots, Lyncestæ,
Orestæ, and Tymphæans fought in separate bodies;<a id="noteref_2009" name="noteref_2009" href="#note_2009"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2009</span></span></a>
and several persons are denoted in the history of Macedon by
the surname of Lyncestes. Perdiccas came from Orestis,
Ptolemy from Eordæa.<a id="noteref_2010" name="noteref_2010" href="#note_2010"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2010</span></span></a> Those in the lowlands, on
the other hand, were known by the general name of Macedonians;
and it should be observed, that there were also Macedonians
dwelling in Pieria, Bottiaïs, Mygdonia, Eordæa, and Almopia,<a id="noteref_2011" name="noteref_2011" href="#note_2011"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2011</span></span></a>
who had, according to Thucydides, driven out the
native inhabitants; while Pæonia and Bisaltia, together with
Anthemus and Crestonica, remained in the possession of
those tribes which had been settled there before the conquest
of Macedonia.<a id="noteref_2012" name="noteref_2012" href="#note_2012"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2012</span></span></a>

20. From what has been already said it is plain that there
was, independently of the extension of the empire of the
Temenidæ, a Macedonian nation possessing from early times
a territory of considerable size, viz., the Macedonia of Herodotus;
the area of which in the accompanying map amounts
to 2400 geographical square miles.

We now proceed to the most important question to be
considered in this treatise, viz., to what national family these
Macedonians belonged.

reference to the settlements of the Pierians at the foot of

Secondly, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Pæonians</span></span>. A numerous race divided into

22. Since the Macedonians evidently belonged to some
one of these four races, our present object is to ascertain
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em>. Now in the first place the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greeks</span></span> may be
excluded, since, although it is certain that a large portion of the Macedonian
nation was of Grecian origin, the Macedonians
were always considered by the Greeks as barbarians.—Alexander
the Philhellene,<a id="noteref_2029" name="noteref_2029" href="#note_2029"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2029</span></span></a>
the father of Perdiccas, represented

a Greek, and satrap over Macedonians; the same person
who was driven off the course at Olympia for being a barbarian,
until he proved his Argive descent.<a id="noteref_2031" name="noteref_2031" href="#note_2031"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2031</span></span></a> The mouth

unless Magnesia also was excluded. Fabulous genealogies,
representing Macedon as the son of Zeus and Thyia the
daughter of Deucalion, or of a descendant of Æolus, are
of no weight against the prevailing opinion of the Greeks;
nor are they necessarily of greater antiquity than the fortieth
Olympiad (620 B.C.),<a id="noteref_2033" name="noteref_2033" href="#note_2033"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2033</span></span></a> at which time Danaus and Ægyptus,
and other races equally unconnected, were made the members
of the same family, when the Scythians were derived
from Hercules,<a id="noteref_2034" name="noteref_2034" href="#note_2034"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2034</span></span></a> and even the whole known world was
comprised in extensive genealogies. It would be unreasonable
to suppose, on the credit of these genealogies, that
there was any other migration of Greeks into Macedonia
except that of the Temenidæ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
23. Secondly, with regard to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Pæonians</span></span>: it may be
shown that the Macedonians did not belong to that nation.<a id="noteref_2035" name="noteref_2035" href="#note_2035"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2035</span></span></a>
The possessions of the Macedonians in Pæonia are accurately
described by ancient writers; these were, until the
time of Perdiccas, only a narrow strip of land;<a id="noteref_2036" name="noteref_2036" href="#note_2036"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2036</span></span></a> Pelagonia
and Pæonia on the Axius were subdued at a later date.
As the Pæonian race was not aboriginal in this district, its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg 473]</span><a name="Pg473" id="Pg473" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
peculiarities were probably easy to be recognised in the
time of Thucydides, and hence this national name occurs
more frequently than those of the separate provinces. For
this reason great importance should be attached to the circumstance
that the ancients never refer the Macedonians
themselves to the Pæonian race; and it should perhaps be
considered as decisive. On the other hand, with aboriginal
races having a large territory and numerous connexions,
such a separation hardly warrants this inference, since
otherwise the Macedonians, whom both Herodotus and
Thucydides mention <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">together with</span></em> Thracians
and Illyrians,<a id="noteref_2037" name="noteref_2037" href="#note_2037"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2037</span></span></a>
could not have belonged to either of those two tribes, and
therefore to no great national division of the human race.
It is, however, plain that the ancients frequently used the
national name in a limited sense, merely for the chief mass
of the people, and did not apply it to particular <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">portions
of it</span></em> which had acquired a character different from that of
the rest of their nation,<a id="noteref_2038" name="noteref_2038" href="#note_2038"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2038</span></span></a> without by this meaning to
express a diversity of origin. We have therefore now only to ascertain
whether the Macedonians were of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thracian</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Illyrian</span></em>
descent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
24. We shall gain one step towards a conclusion by inquiring
in what region were the original settlements of the
Macedonians; a question which should carefully be distinguished
from the former investigation as to the first station
of the Temenidæ. Now in pursuing this inquiry, we soon
perceive that even of Macedonia Proper, from which Bottiæa,
Pieria, and Eordæa were conquered, a large part was
not always in the possession of the Macedonians. Homer,
for example, places Emathia, not Macedonia, between Pieria
and Chalcidice.<a id="noteref_2039" name="noteref_2039" href="#note_2039"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2039</span></span></a> Several writers state in general that Macedonia

could say that Emathia, at a distance from the coast, had in
early times been called Pæonia. For the ancient name of
Emathia had evidently been extended to a tract of land
belonging to Pæonia, which had, perhaps, previously to the
Pæonian conquests, once borne the name of Emathia.

to the sea, was not originally called Macedonia, yet we find
traces of the existence of the name of the Macedonians
under its ancient forms of Μακέται and Μακεδνοὶ, in the hill-country
near the ridge of Pindus. Herodotus says that the
Doric race, having been driven from Hestiæotis, and dwelling
under mount Pindus, was called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macedonian
nation</span></span>.<a id="noteref_2047" name="noteref_2047" href="#note_2047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2047</span></span></a>
By this statement he plainly means that the Dorians were
first known by that name in Peloponnesus;<a id="noteref_2048" name="noteref_2048" href="#note_2048"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2048</span></span></a> and indeed
his other notions on the progress of this people are only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a name="Pg475" id="Pg475" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suited to the childhood of history. But notwithstanding
the erroneous conclusions of the narrator, it is allowable to
infer from his statement that the Macedonians had once
dwelt at the foot of Pindus—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, probably in one of the
districts of Upper Macedonia; of which provinces Orestis
may be considered (on the faith of a conjectural emendation)
as the ancient Maceta.<a id="noteref_2049" name="noteref_2049" href="#note_2049"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2049</span></span></a> For it cannot be a Thessalian
district that is alluded to, since Maceta was, as we know
from certain testimony, in fact a part of Macedonia. This
hypothesis is also supported by the ancient patronymic
surname of the Macedonian kings, <span class="tei tei-q">“Argeadæ;”</span> if it is
rightly derived by Appian from Argos in Orestis.<a id="noteref_2050" name="noteref_2050" href="#note_2050"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2050</span></span></a>

The fact that the ancient country of the Macedonians
was near the ridge of mountains on the confines of Illyria,
and was at a considerable distance from Thrace, renders it
probable that the Macetæ were of Illyrian blood; but this
probability would yield to arguments drawn from the language,
costume, and manners of the three nations. The
question therefore is, whom did the Macedonians in the

as one nation obtained the dominion over others, the whole

Pelagonia, Orestias and Elimea was once called
Upper Macedonia, and at a later period the Independent.

27. Now, although the historical accounts of Strabo,
collected at a time when these regions had been ravaged by
conquest, and had undergone manifold changes, have not
the value which the statements of Herodotus and Thucydides
possess, yet it is possible to extract from them much
information. In the first place it should be observed that
the Epirots and the Illyrians are not considered as two
wholly distinct nations. The Epirots, although in early
times allied by blood with the Greeks, were always considered
as barbarians,<a id="noteref_2062" name="noteref_2062" href="#note_2062"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2062</span></span></a> and Ambracia as the last city in
Greece;<a id="noteref_2063" name="noteref_2063" href="#note_2063"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2063</span></span></a> which fact, since the
original inhabitants were the
same as in Arcadia, that is, Pelasgians, can only be explained
by supposing that there had been a mixture of
Illyrians. Hence it might be at that late time difficult to
distinguish between the Epirots and the Illyrians; and thus
Strabo includes the Atintanes, who according to Scylax<a id="noteref_2064" name="noteref_2064" href="#note_2064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2064</span></span></a>
and Appian<a id="noteref_2065" name="noteref_2065" href="#note_2065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2065</span></span></a> were Illyrians, among the Epirot nations.
It is more singular that he should consider the Orestæ,
whom Polybius<a id="noteref_2066" name="noteref_2066" href="#note_2066"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2066</span></span></a> recognises as a Macedonian people, as
Epirots; but it may be probably accounted for by the circumstance
of their separation from the cause of the Macedonian
kings, which procured them their independence in
the year of the city 556.<a id="noteref_2067" name="noteref_2067" href="#note_2067"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2067</span></span></a> But the other inhabitants of
Upper Macedonia, the genuine Macedonians, such as the
Lyncestæ and Elimiots (who probably, from being mountaineers,
had preserved their national distinctions more than
the civilised tribes of the lowlands), were considered by
Strabo, as the context plainly shows, as original Illyrians;
and it can hardly be doubted that they still bore the characteristic
marks of that nation.

Strabo here speaks. The importance of these points for
the discovery of national affinity is easily perceived. Indeed,
many Grecian tribes might be distinguished merely by
their mode of wearing the hair.<a id="noteref_2072" name="noteref_2072" href="#note_2072"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2072</span></span></a> The chlamys had come to

circumstance is, that the same cap which is borne by the riders on the

the Illyrian king Gentius.<a id="noteref_2080" name="noteref_2080" href="#note_2080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2080</span></span></a> Lastly, the similarity of dialect
is a decisive proof. Now that all these things should have
been introduced by the Macedonian kings seems highly
improbable, when it is remembered that their rule did not
even extend over the whole of this tract, that it was also
often interrupted, and in general not of a nature to alter
the character, language, and costume of the natives.<a id="noteref_2081" name="noteref_2081" href="#note_2081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2081</span></span></a>

considered that, according to ancient tradition, the early inhabitants of
this country were of the Pelasgic race. It is likewise fair,
by the guidance of several parallel cases in the Greek mythology,
to interpret the legend that Lycaon the Arcadian
hero had once ruled in Emathia, and was the father of
Macedon,<a id="noteref_2085" name="noteref_2085" href="#note_2085"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2085</span></span></a>
as signifying merely the succession, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">according to

occupation of this country; which the language of mythology
expressed by placing the respective races in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genealogical</span></em>
connexion. So Thessalus is called a son of Jason,
although the Thessalians belonged to a different race from
the early rulers of the country, the Minyæ of Iolcus, of
whom Jason was one. Hence it is highly probable that at
the first conquest of this tract of land, viz., of Macedonia
Proper, nations akin to the Greeks were mixed with the
Illyrians.

with Grecian, with Pæonian, and with Thracian tribes,
which they either subdued or dislodged; but no expulsion
was probably so complete that some part of the former
population was not left behind. Among the tribes thus
driven out were the Bottiæans, who were reported to have

It has been already shown that the common population of
Leibethrum and Pieria was at least nearly related to the

32. In order to trace the national character and origin
of the Macedonians, it is necessary to distinguish three
things; first, their Illyrian descent; secondly, their extension

over other, for the most part Grecian countries; and
thirdly, the introduction by the ruling family, of the civilisation
and refinements of the Greeks; which must have gained
great ground when Alexander the Philhellene offered himself
as a combatant at the Olympic games, and honoured
the poetry of Pindar;<a id="noteref_2101" name="noteref_2101" href="#note_2101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2101</span></span></a> and when Archelaus, the

tragedies of Euripides acted at his court under the
direction of that poet. These changes must have chiefly
affected the regions near the sea; for they could not have
equally extended to the Macedonians of Lyncus, &amp;c., who,
even in the time of Strabo, had the greatest resemblance to
the Dassaretians, Taulantians, &amp;c., and, until the overthrow
of the Macedonian monarchy, preserved their ancient savage
habits; which Livy only partially accounts for by their intercourse
with neighbouring barbarians.<a id="noteref_2104" name="noteref_2104" href="#note_2104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2104</span></span></a>

35. On the other hand, a military disposition, which still
distinguished the Macedonians in the time of Polybius,
personal valour, and a certain freedom of spirit, were the
national characteristics of this people. Long before Philip
organised his phalanx, the cavalry of Macedon was greatly
celebrated, especially that of the highlands, as is shown by
the tetradrachms of Alexander the First. In smaller numbers
they attacked the close array of the Thracians of

36. It is difficult to treat of the Macedonian language,
as not only the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ancient</span></em> period of the native dialect must be
distinguished from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em>, in which the Grecian language
was partially introduced, after Archelaus, Philip, and
Alexander made their people acquainted with Athenian
civilisation, but also from a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>, in which many barbarous
words were adopted from the mixture of the Macedonians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg 486]</span><a name="Pg486" id="Pg486" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with Indians, Persians, and Egyptians.<a id="noteref_2129" name="noteref_2129" href="#note_2129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2129</span></span></a> Nevertheless it
is possible to form a well-grounded opinion as to the form of
the Macedonian language in the first period. In the first
place, they had many barbarous words for very simple and
common objects,<a id="noteref_2130" name="noteref_2130" href="#note_2130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2130</span></span></a> which may be certainly considered as
Illyrian, since among the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very scanty</span></em> relics of the Illyrian
and Athamanian dialects<a id="noteref_2131" name="noteref_2131" href="#note_2131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2131</span></span></a> there are some words which are
also mentioned as Macedonian.<a id="noteref_2132" name="noteref_2132" href="#note_2132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2132</span></span></a> Indeed, without supposing
some barbarous foundation of this kind, we could hardly
account for the Macedonian language being still unintelligible
to the Greeks in the time of Alexander the Great.<a id="noteref_2133" name="noteref_2133" href="#note_2133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2133</span></span></a>
Yet it cannot be doubted that the Greek had passed into
the Illyrian dialect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> the introduction of Athenian literature,
and that their combination produced the mongrel
language which was afterwards called Macedonian. The
nominatives in α, such as ἱππότα, πολῖτα, &amp;c., could not have
been derived from the Athenians; but the Thessalians, the
Dryopians, and probably all the Pelasgians, used that
form.<a id="noteref_2134" name="noteref_2134" href="#note_2134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2134</span></span></a> That some mixture of Greek had taken place at an
early period seems also to be proved by the great and
almost inexplicable change which the Grecian words experienced
in the mouth of the Macedonians, who appear to
have been unable to pronounce the letters Φ and Θ, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a name="Pg487" id="Pg487" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hence they always substituted Β for the former, and Δ for
the latter,<a id="noteref_2135" name="noteref_2135" href="#note_2135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2135</span></span></a>
perhaps from a peculiarity of the Illyrian nation.
On the other hand, the Macedonian language had a consonant
ΟΥ or V, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volustana</span></span>, the name of the country
round Olympus,<a id="noteref_2136" name="noteref_2136" href="#note_2136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2136</span></span></a> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Candavian</span></span>

to the vocal system of the Latin.

Since the annexed Map is entirely copied from that of
Barbié du Bocage, as far as the country is concerned, I will
only remark some important points in which Arrowsmith's
great Map of Turkey, which is in part founded on quite
different authorities, differs from it. In this Map the small
lake to the east of Lychnis, or Lychnitis (the lake of
Ochrida), is not connected with any river running to the
coast, and the mountains to the west of it stretch uninterruptedly
to the south. (Perhaps this is correct: see p. <a href="#Pg453" class="tei tei-ref">453</a>,
note g.
[Transcriber's Note: This is the footnote to <span class="tei tei-q">“Candavian chain,”</span>
starting <span class="tei tei-q">“Ptolemy.”</span>]) The Haliacmon rises rather more to the north
than in Barbié du Bocage's Map. The Cara-Sou, which
is certainly the Erigon, runs into the lake of the Lydias.
(Incorrect, according to Strabo, quoted in p. <a href="#Pg451" class="tei tei-ref">451</a>, note b.
[Transcriber's Note: This is the footnote to <span class="tei tei-q">“mountains of Illyria,”</span>
starting <span class="tei tei-q">“Its rise in these mountains.”</span>])
The Lydias has a longer course, and rises in the Illyrian
mountains. The modern river Gallico, which I make the
Echeidorus, flows at some distance from the sea through a
lake into the Axius. The tributary branch of the Achelous,
called by the ancients the Inachus, rises further to the south,
under the Pindus-chain (contrary to the authors quoted in
p. <a href="#Pg452" class="tei tei-ref">452</a>, note f.
[Transcriber's Note: This is the footnote to <span class="tei tei-q">“Epirus of Lacmon,”</span>

Map is without doubt the more accurate.

There is a particular tendency which may be traced
throughout all the accounts that have come down to us of
early Grecian history, viz., of reducing everything to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genealogical</span></em>
form. It was much encouraged by the opinion of
the later historians, that every town and valley had received
its name from some ancient prince or hero; thus even Pausanias
meets with persons who explained everything by means
of genealogies;<a id="noteref_2138" name="noteref_2138" href="#note_2138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2138</span></span></a> who, for example, out of the Pythian temple
at Delphi made a son of Delphus Pythis, a prince of early
times. This tendency, however, is manifestly founded on
the genuine ancient language of mythology. With the inventors
of these fabulous narratives, nations, cities, mountains,
rivers, and gods became real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">persons</span></em>, who stood to
one another in the relation of human beings, were arranged
in families, and joined to one another in marriage. Now
although such fictions are in many cases easily seen through,
and the meaning of the connexion may be readily deciphered,
yet these genealogies, as there was nothing of arbitrary
and fanciful invention in them, in after-times passed
for real history; and were, both by early and late historians,
with full confidence in their general accuracy, made use of
for the establishment of a sort of chronology. On these
principles, then, the genealogies which were formed in the
age of the later epic poets, and perhaps even of the early
historians, cannot be considered as pure invention; these too
must have been founded on certain arguments and facts,
which were generally believed at that time. We will endeavour
to point this out in the famous genealogy of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page490">[pg 490]</span><a name="Pg490" id="Pg490" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

It is evident that the above genealogy was intended to
represent the chief races of the Hellenes, or Greeks, as belonging
to one nation; and consequently could not have
been made before the name Hellenes was applied to the
whole nation; which in the Iliad<a id="noteref_2142" name="noteref_2142" href="#note_2142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2142</span></span></a> is only the name of a

above genealogy cannot have been formed. But that the
author of it did not make an arbitrary fiction is evident
from the circumstance that he put Xuthus instead of
Achæus and Ion; by which he greatly deranged the symmetry
of his genealogy. It is clear that he thought himself
bound to respect the tradition, that Achæus and Ion were
the sons of Xuthus; which prevented him from making
Hellen their father. As yet, therefore, the other brothers
were not recognised in tradition as having any fathers; and
some obscure legends, such as that of Dorus, the son of
Apollo,<a id="noteref_2146" name="noteref_2146" href="#note_2146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2146</span></span></a> had not obtained a general belief.
There can be no doubt that Hellen was recognised in the most ancient
tradition. Now in the fictions of mythology the invention
was bound by a sort of fanciful regularity; and in a fabulous
genealogy the part was deduced from the whole, the
species from the genus, as an inferior and subordinate being:
thus in the Theogony the hills are the children of the earth,
and the sun and the moon of light.<a id="noteref_2147" name="noteref_2147" href="#note_2147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2147</span></span></a>
Accordingly the poet (or whoever was his authority) sang of Æolus, Dorus, and
Xuthus, the progenitors of nations, being the sons of
Hellen, the son of Zeus, or grandson of Prometheus. It
is possible that before this entire genealogy others had
been invented, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dorus</span></em> was a son of Hellen; since,
as early as the time of Lycurgus, the Spartans were commanded
by the Pythian oracle to worship Zeus Hellanius
and Athene Hellania;<a id="noteref_2148" name="noteref_2148" href="#note_2148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2148</span></span></a> and since both the judges in the
Spartan army<a id="noteref_2149" name="noteref_2149" href="#note_2149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2149</span></span></a>
and the judges of the Olympic games were
called Hellanodicæ. And when I consider the celebrated
oracle just quoted, and the close connexion of Sparta and
Olympia with Delphi, the sacred families of the Delphians
(the ὅσιοι), who referred their origin to
Deucalion,<a id="noteref_2150" name="noteref_2150" href="#note_2150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2150</span></span></a> and on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page492">[pg 492]</span><a name="Pg492" id="Pg492" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the other hand remember that a Bœotian poem, composed
in the neighbourhood of the Pythian oracle, first uses the
word <span class="tei tei-q">“Hellenes”</span> in this extended sense; I cannot help
conjecturing that this national sanctuary of the Hellenic
name had a large share in the formation of that really beautiful
legend; by which all the different races of Greece,
separated for so many centuries by violent and unceasing
contention, were united into the peaceable fellowship of
brotherly affection and concord.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cnosus,<a id="noteref_2151" name="noteref_2151" href="#note_2151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2151</span></span></a> the Minoian Cnosus, was, even so late as the
time of Plato, the first city in Crete, and the chief domicile
of the Cretan laws and customs: and Plato, in his Treatise
on Laws, takes a Cnosian as the representative and defender
of the Cretan laws in general;<a id="noteref_2152" name="noteref_2152" href="#note_2152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2152</span></span></a> although Cnosus
about his time had declined from internal corruption, and
the fame of having preserved the good laws of ancient Crete
soon passed from her to Gortyna and Lyctus.<a id="noteref_2153" name="noteref_2153" href="#note_2153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2153</span></span></a> In earlier
times, however, the Cretan laws (Κρητικοὶ νόμοι), which
Archilochus even mentions as being of a distinct character,<a id="noteref_2154" name="noteref_2154" href="#note_2154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2154</span></span></a>
were preserved in the greatest purity at Cnosus. Now
when modern writers admit indeed that the Cretan laws
were founded upon the customs of the Doric race, but affirm
that this race did not penetrate into Crete before the expedition
of the Heraclidæ, and that migrations subsequently
took place from Peloponnesus; it is necessary for them
first of all to show that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Cnosus</span></em> received its Doric inhabitants
from that country, that is, probably either from Argos
or Sparta. But had such been the case, the memory of these
migrations would assuredly never have been lost: Argos
and Sparta would have been too proud to possess such a
colony. Cnosus must therefore have received its Doric inhabitants
at an earlier date, in the dark ages of mythology;
and the subsequent colonies from Peloponnesus to Lyctus,
Gortyna, and other places, helped to increase the Doric
population, which in Homer's time<a id="noteref_2155" name="noteref_2155" href="#note_2155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2155</span></span></a> was confined to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">part</span></em>
of the island, over the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em> of Crete; as was the case in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page494">[pg 494]</span><a name="Pg494" id="Pg494" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
late ages. And at the time which Homer describes, not
only the language, but the customs and laws were probably
also different; whereas Archilochus appears to mention the
Cretan laws as prevalent over the whole island. Upon the
whole, the Dorians in Crete—and this is a fact of great importance—never
seem to stand, with regard to the Dorians
of Peloponnesus, in the relation of a colony to its mother
country. In Greece, the parent state—so great was the
pride of higher antiquity—never condescended to take the
institutions of a colony as models for its own, as was the case
with Sparta and Crete; nor did the mother country ever
procure priests from its colony, as was the case when the
Pythian Apollo sent Cretan priests to Sparta.<a id="noteref_2156" name="noteref_2156" href="#note_2156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2156</span></span></a> In short,
everything seems to prove that the Doric institutions were
of great antiquity in Crete, and that the distinction which
has lately been taken between the laws of Minos and the
Doric institutions and customs of Crete—a distinction
directly opposed to the unanimous testimony of antiquity—is
false and untenable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in retaining his conviction respecting a Doric settlement
in Crete before the migration of the Heraclidæ, and
in viewing it as the only means of explaining many facts in
the religious and political history of the Greeks, the Author
does not imply that this Doric colony was exactly similar to
a later migration of Dorians from Argos and Sparta. The
condition of the Dorians in Hestiæotis must have been very
different from that to which the same race attained in
Peloponnesus. The mixture with other races, which had
gone so far, that the head of the mythical settlement bears a
Pelasgic name (Teutamus), does not agree with the character
of the later Dorians. At that time no line of princes,
calling themselves Heraclidæ, could have stood at the head
of the Dorians; for in Crete, Heraclidæ only occur in cities
which were colonised from Peloponnesus; for example, they
do not occur in Cnosus. Moreover, a maritime, and especially
a piratical life (upon which the maritime supremacy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg 495]</span><a name="Pg495" id="Pg495" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Minos was founded) does not agree with the principles
followed by the Dorians in Peloponnesus, where they relied
upon a tranquil and secure possession of land. These principles,
however, could not be developed so long as the
Dorians were excluded from the rich plain of Thessaly,
and were forced to eke out their scanty means by hunting
and piracy. How different was the rough and perilous life
of the ancient sea-kings of the Normans from the proud and
secure existence of the barons in Normandy! Yet the eye
of the observant historian can trace a unity of national
character even in the most different circumstances. By a
similar analogy, this remarkable expedition of Doric adventurers
from Hestiæotis to Crete will explain the zeal of the
Cretans for the worship of Apollo, the ancient connexion of
Crete and Delphi, and the early existence in Crete of
notions respecting a strict regulation of public life (κόσμος).

Persian war.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. In the present article it will be my object to trace the
foreign influence which Sparta possessed at the time of the
Persian war, and for what length of time her supremacy
in Greece remained uncontested and unshaken. This is
chiefly seen in the proceedings of the congress of the allied
Greek states: to ascertain which with precision, it will be
first necessary to fix the chronology of the successive stages
of the Persian war.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the course of the year 481 B.C. (Olymp. 74. 3/4)
Xerxes set out from his residence at Susa (Herod. VII.
20), found the great army assembled in Cappadocia, and
marched to Sardis, from which town he sent ambassadors to
the Greek cities (ib. 32). Having wintered here, the army
marched in the spring of 480 B.C. (Olymp. 74. 4) to
Abydos;<a id="noteref_2157" name="noteref_2157" href="#note_2157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2157</span></span></a> when it had reached the passes of Pieria,
the Persian envoys returned (ib. 131). Soon after this they
met at Thermopylæ the Greek forces, which had set out
before the 75th Olympiad and the Carnean games, about
June 480 B.C. Battles of Thermopylæ and Artemisium
in μέσον θέρος (VIII. 12.) both perhaps a short time before
the Olympic festival (VIII. 26). Conquest of Attica, four
months after the beginning of the διάβασις τοῦ Ἑλλησπόντου
(VIII. 51). Battle of Salamis, a little after the time of the
Ιακχος, after the εἰκὰς of Boëdromion Olymp. 75. 1., as the
Etesian winds were either blowing or had ceased to blow
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg 498]</span><a name="Pg498" id="Pg498" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(they last from the summer solstice to the rising of the dog-star),
VII. 168. Mardonius winters in Thessaly and Macedonia,
the Persian fleet at Cume and Samos. Battle of
Platæa on the 26th or 27th of Panemus (Metagitnion),
Olymp. 75. 2. 479 B.C. at the same time as that of Mycale.
The year ends with the taking of Sestos.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Greeks certainly received early intelligence of the
preparations in Persia (VII. 138), even if the story related
by Herodotus (VII. 239.) about the secret message of Demaratus
is not true. They either refused or gave earth and
water to the envoys late in the year 481 B.C. (VII. 138.).
The states which refused to submit held a congress;<a id="noteref_2158" name="noteref_2158" href="#note_2158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2158</span></span></a> and
they are now called by Herodotus, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Greeks allied
against the Persians,”</span> (οἱ συνωμόται Ἑλλήνων ἐπὶ τῷ Πέρσῃ,
VII. 148.). This assembly of course was formed by deputies
from the different cities: the manner of its formation
may be inferred from the place at which it sat; and it will
be shown presently that it first assembled at Corinth, which
city belonged to the Peloponnesian confederacy. It appears
therefore that Sparta must have convened an assembly at
Corinth, to which the extra-Peloponnesian states, which
had refused earth and water, sent envoys. This congress
first put an end to the internal dissensions of Greece (VII.
145.), in which good service Chileus of Tegea and Themistocles
are said to have earned the gratitude of their countrymen
(Plutarch Themist. 6.). Secondly, when they heard
that Xerxes was at Sardis, they despatched spies thither,
and at the same time envoys to Argos, Sicily, Corcyra, and
Crete. (VII. 145. 199.) The envoys are stated by Herodotus
to have been sent by the Lacedæmonians and their
allies.<a id="noteref_2159" name="noteref_2159" href="#note_2159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2159</span></span></a> They also made a vow to decimate to the Delphian
God all those Greeks who had unnecessarily given
earth and water to the Persians (VII. 132.); the persons
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg 499]</span><a name="Pg499" id="Pg499" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who made this vow are called by Diodorus XI. 3. <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Greeks assembled in congress at the Isthmus,”</span> οἱ ἐν Ἰσθμῷ
συνεδρεύοντες τῶν Ἑλλήνων.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. In this narrative taken from Herodotus there still remains
one contradiction, viz., that if the Greeks did not assemble
till after they had refused earth and water (as appears
from VII. 138. cf. 145.), the Argives had no longer
any option whether they would join the league or not.
Likewise the dismission of the Greek envoys would fall too
late in the unfavourable season for sailing, and there would
scarcely be time for the messages to the oracles (c. 148,
169.), and the other proceedings. It is therefore probable
that this congress was formed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> the arrival of the Persian
envoys, which was late in 481 B.C.: and Diodorus
seems to be correct in stating that of the nations some gave
earth and water, while the Persian army was in the valley
of Tempe, and others after its departure (XI. 3.); and
therefore none till early in 480 B.C.: previously the ambassadors
were probably in the north; Herodotus in VII.
138. appears to mean only the ambassadors of Darius.
With this the following statements agree, which he adds in
VII. 172. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">As soon as</span></em> the Thessalians had heard that
the Persians wished to invade Europe”</span>—which they must
have known in the winter of 481-80 B.C.—<span class="tei tei-q">“they sent envoys
to the Isthmus.”</span> Ἐν δὲ τῷ Ἰσθμῷ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in the village
which had grown up about the temple of Neptune), ἔσαν
ἁλισμένοι πρόβουλοι (plenipotentiaries, VI. 7.) τῆς Ἑλλάδος,
ἀραιρημένοι ἀπὸ τῶν πολίων τῶν τὰ ἀμείνω φρονεουσέων περὶ τὴν
Ἑλλάδα. Now this assembly, while the Persian king was
at Abydos, and therefore very early in 480 B.C., sent the
army to Tempe, which soon returned (VII. 173.), and indeed
returned to the Isthmus, which must therefore have
been the head-quarters of the allied army. When it returned,
the congress was still sitting at the Isthmus.<a id="noteref_2160" name="noteref_2160" href="#note_2160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2160</span></span></a> This
synedrion or assembly (which is again mentioned in this
place by Diodorus XI. 4.) now resolved to defend the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a name="Pg500" id="Pg500" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
passes of Thermopylæ and Artemisium: and when the intelligence
arrived that the Persians were in Pieria, διαλυθέντες
ἐκ τοῦ Ἰσθμοῦ (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, departing from the Isthmus) ἐστρατεύοντο
αὐτῶν οἱ μὲν ἐς Θερμοπύλας πεζῇ, ἄλλοι δὲ κατὰ θάλασσαν ἐπ᾽
Ἀρτεμίσιον. But that the Isthmus was still the place in
which the congress sat, is evident from the fact, that Sandoces,
Aridolis, and Penthylus, who fell into the hands of
the Greeks before the battle of Artemisium, were sent
thither (VII. 195.). At this time indeed the Peloponnesians
were celebrating the Olympiad, and the Spartans the
Carnea, at their respective homes,<a id="noteref_2161" name="noteref_2161" href="#note_2161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2161</span></span></a> after which, as had been
previously arranged, they were to take the field with all
their forces (πανδημεὶ, VII. 206. VIII. 26.). Nevertheless,
the decree that the ships which came too late for Artemisium
should assemble in the Trœzenian Pogon (VIII. 42.),
as well as the other, that the Isthmus should be fortified
(VIII. 40, 71.), which measure was not thought of before
the battle of Thermopylæ, must have been passed in this
interval. Diodorus (XI. 16.) mentions the synedrion in
connexion with this decree. The fortification began after
the Carnea (VIII. 72.). The fleet was commanded (as is
evident from VIII. 2, 9, 56, 58, 74, 108, 111. IX. 90.) by
the Spartan admiral and a council, a συνέδριον of the στρατηγοὶ
or ἐν τέλει ὄντες (IX. 106.), in which the admiral τὸν
λόγον προετίθει (VIII. 59.) put the question to the vote
(ἐπεψήφιζε, c. 61.), and gave out the decree. This commander
was armed with very large powers, and Leotychidas
concluded an alliance with the Samians (IX. 92.), and
even the captains of the fleet debated on the projected migration
of the Ionians (IX. 106.). Nor is it ever mentioned
that the fleet received orders from the Isthmus. But the
circumstance of the fleet's sailing to the Isthmus, after the
battle of Salamis, for the decree on the ἀριστεῖα (VIII. 123.),
is a proof that the Isthmus was still the seat of the confederate
assembly. Diodorus likewise represents this decree
as proceeding from the συνέδριον (XI. 55.); probably the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg 501]</span><a name="Pg501" id="Pg501" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Greeks,”</span> who refused to confirm the vote of the commanders
(VIII. 124.), were the members of the league.
The ships which had been engaged in the battle returned
home without any decision. Late in the year, after the
eclipse of the sun on the 2nd of October, Cleombrotus had
led the great allied army from the Isthmus, and soon afterwards
died (IX. 10.). The decree for the following year,
that the fleet should go to Ægina (VIII. 131.), may have
proceeded either from the synedrium of the preceding year,
or from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sparta</span></em>. For that there were no longer any deputies
assembled at Corinth is evident from the circumstance
that the Ionian envoys only went to Sparta and
Ægina (VIII. 132.); nor is the Isthmus afterwards mentioned
as the seat of an assembly, although it was fortified
until the middle of summer, till the time of the Hyacinthia
(IX. 7.). After this time, Athens, Platæa, and Megara
sent their envoys to Sparta, where there were also Peloponnesian
envoys, as for instance Chileus of Tegea (IX. 9.),
who was mentioned above among the πρόβουλοι; and all
these, together with the ambassadors of the three states just
mentioned, are, as it appears, called by Herodotus οἱ ἄγγελοι
οἱ ἀπιγμένοι ἀπὸ τῶν πολίων, IX. 10. There must probably
have been some joint act of the allies,<a id="noteref_2162" name="noteref_2162" href="#note_2162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2162</span></span></a> by virtue of
which Pausanias was able to collect the great Peloponnesian
army. After the battle of Platæa there was in the army
a kind of council of war, doubtless a συνέδριον τῶν ἐν τέλει
ὄντων, which regulated the number of the sacred offerings,
divided the booty (IX. 81, 85.), and determined on the
expedition against Thebes (c. 86.): the persons who were
given up, Pausanias seems at Corinth to have ordered to
execution on his own authority (c. 88.).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Such is the substance of the narrative of Herodotus;
in which we can only be surprised, that of the most remarkable
event, viz., the treaty of Pausanias, he should say not
a word: a silence which can only be explained by supposing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page502">[pg 502]</span><a name="Pg502" id="Pg502" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that he had intended to mention it in another passage of
his unfinished work. When Pausanias, with the assistance
of the allies, had won the battle of Platæa, he sacrificed
in the market-place of Platæa to Zeus Eleutherius, and
convened an assembly of all the Greeks, in which the Platæans
(who annually performed certain honorary rites to
those who had fallen in the battle, Thuc. III. 58.) were
promised that their country and city should remain independent,
and that no one should attack them without lawful
reason, or with intention to reduce them to subjection:
and that, in case these conditions were not observed, all the
allies then present would protect them (Thuc. VI. 71. cf.
III. 56, 59.); an engagement which the Spartans themselves
afterwards broke, on the ground that the Platæans had first
unjustly given up τὸ ξυνώμοτον (II. 74.). For in <span class="tei tei-q">“the ancient
treaty of Pausanias after the Persian war,”</span> it was
ordered that the allies in general, and the Platæans among
them, should remain at peace with each other (Thuc. III.
68. cf. II. 72.). The further conditions of this treaty may
be collected from Thucyd. I. 67, (for it is evidently this
treaty which is in question,) where the Æginetans complain
that they are not independent, <span class="tei tei-q">“according to the treaty;”</span>
for the thirty years' truce (I. 115.) cannot be meant, as it
was not concluded till after the subjection of Ægina (the
former in Olymp. 83. 3. the latter in Olymp. 80. 4.);
whence it is likewise evident that the treaty, which was violated
by the siege of Potidæa, and the exclusion of the
Megarians from the market of Attica, (I. 67, 87. cf. c. 144.)
was the same ancient act, only renewed by later treaties.
Thus Plutarch states that the latter prohibition was <span class="tei tei-q">“contrary
to the common principles of justice, and the solemn
oaths of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Greeks</span></em>.”</span><a id="noteref_2163" name="noteref_2163" href="#note_2163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2163</span></span></a>
And in another place he mentions
that, in a general assembly of the Greeks after the
battle of Platæa, Aristides proposed a decree that the
Greeks should annually send deputies and sacred messengers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg 503]</span><a name="Pg503" id="Pg503" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to Platæa, and that the Eleutheria should be solemnised
every five years.<a id="noteref_2164" name="noteref_2164" href="#note_2164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2164</span></span></a> Also, that it was agreed that an
allied Greek armament should be organised against the
Persians, consisting of 10,000 heavy-armed infantry, 1000
cavalry, and 100 ships: and that the Platæans should be considered
sacred and inviolable. From what has been stated
above, it is clear how much of this account is true, and how
much added by Athenian partiality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. In the following years, when Sparta still continued
the war against the Persians and their allies by means of
Pausanias and Leotychidas, there must have been a congress,
though not constantly sitting; since the Spartans
would not have determined the amount of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
war contribution”</span><a id="noteref_2165" name="noteref_2165" href="#note_2165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2165</span></span></a>
on their own authority; and there is much probability
in the account of Diodorus (XI. 55.), that the
Spartans summoned Themistocles for his share in the treason
of Pausanias before the common-council of the Greeks,
which used at this time to assemble at Sparta. At least it
is not contradicted by Thucydides; indeed his narrative
(I. 135.) perfectly agrees in this point with that of Diodorus.
The words ἐν τῇ Σπάρτῃ, which are omitted in some MSS.
of Diodorus, and suspected by Wesseling (yet, it should be
observed, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> these words), cannot be well spared; and,
even if they were expunged, the whole chapter would show
that the congress was sitting at Sparta; for it was evidently
under Lacedæmonian influence, and therefore met in the
Peloponnese; and, since the instance mentioned above, it
does not appear that any of its meetings were held at the
Isthmus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This account likewise proves that, after Pausanias had
occasioned the defection of the Ionians and Æolians from
Sparta, who were now considered as the separate allies of
Athens, a confederate council, which included other states
besides the Peloponnesians, continued to sit at Sparta; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page504">[pg 504]</span><a name="Pg504" id="Pg504" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
affords fresh grounds for supposing that this abandonment
of the Spartan alliance was not considered as a transfer of
the chief command to Athens, but that Sparta only intrusted
the Athenians, together with those Greeks who
dwelt in the territory of the Persian king, with the continuation
of the war in Asia, and the management of all
affairs connected with it; and still considered Athens as
under her command, until that state revolted in Olymp. 79.
At last the internal wars of Peloponnesus, Olymp. 79-81,
subverted all the relations of Athens and Sparta.

The confusion of the names of
Hesiod and Cercops may, as it
appears to me, be accounted for
as follows. A verse concerning
the desertion of Ariadne by
Theseus for the sake of Ægle,
is ascribed by Plutarch (vit.
Thes. 20) to Hesiod, and by
Athenæus (XIII. p. 557 A.)
to Cercops; it is evidently from
the Ægimius which was attributed
to both these names. This
verse was expunged from the
poem by Pisistratus, as we learn
from Hereas, quoted by Plutarch.
The Ægimius therefore was at
that time arranged and set down
in writing, together with other
epic poems. Consequently Cercops,
an Orphic Pythagorean,
who lived about the time of
Pisistratus, cannot have been
the author of it, though he might
have been the διασκευαστὴς who
arranged it in the same manner
that Onomacritus did the other
poems. Now it might easily
happen, especially if his interpolations
could be now and then
discerned, that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em> poem

The last words must be considered
as a mere ignorant addition;
for the Dorians did not
divide <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> territory into three
parts, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because</span></em> two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em> Greek
races went to Crete. It is, indeed,
evident that a threefold
division of the land conquered
by the Dorians is here spoken
of, which, as is plain from the
fables concerning Ægimius and
Hercules, took place according
to the three tribes. According
to the present reading, this division
took place at a distance
from the native country of the
Dorians. There might seem
some difficulty in this, since
Hercules is said to have given
Ægimius the third part of the
territory as a παρακαταθήκη in
Hestiæotis, the most ancient habitation
of the Dorians (Diod.
IV. 37, compare Apollodorus
II. 7, 3). Hence πάτρῃς for
πάτρης might be read in this
sense: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Dorians divided
their territory into three parts
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the families</span></em> (of which the
φυλαὶ or tribes consisted),”</span>
so that they then dwelt separately
from one another (similarly
Pindar Olym. p. VII. 74).
This alteration, however, appears
to be unnecessary; and the
old reading is defended by the
following explanation, viz., that
according to the ancient fable
Hyllus and his descendants did
not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dwell</span></em> either near mount
Œta, or in Hestiæotis <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">together</span></em>
with the Dorians, but that they
first received in the Peloponnese
the third part of the territory,
whither they came as colonists
at a distance from their more
ancient abodes (ἔκας πάτρης).</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_112" name="note_112" href="#noteref_112">112.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Below, ch. 3, § 1.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_113" name="note_113" href="#noteref_113">113.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Hom.

of Pamphilus (Aristoph.

or a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">picture</span></em>, was frequently
contested by the ancients.
The latter appears to
be most probable: see Winckelmann
and Meyer Kunstgeschichte,

painted the battle of Phlius,
one of those which took place
in the 102nd or 103rd Olympiad;
and it may be fairly supposed
that he flourished about
Olymp. 97, 4, the year in which
the second edition of the Plutus
was brought forward, and he
might have lived to be the master
of Apelles, who had obtained
great celebrity in the reign
of Philip.—Concerning the battle,

Lacedæmonian word for <span class="tei tei-q">“statue.”</span>
These πομπεῖς δαίμονες,
the <span class="tei tei-q">“conducting deities,”</span> were
probably Zeus Agetor (book
III. ch. 12. § 5.) and the Carnean
Apollo: and their festival
doubtless was connected with
the Carnea. At this solemnity
then (as it seems) a boat was
carried round, and upon it a
statue of the Carnean Apollo
(Ἀπόλλων στεμματίας), both
adorned with lustratory garlands,
called δίκηλον στεμματιαῖον,

is no necessity for assuming
that the poet intended to represent
Tlepolemus as a Rhodian.
In the catalogue, indeed, four
insular Greeks are mentioned,
Nireus of Syme, Antiphus and
Phidippus of Cos, and Tlepolemus
of Rhodes (Il. B. 653-680).
But of these the three
first are not elsewhere mentioned.
Tlepolemus therefore
remains the only Greek, of the
Asiatic colonies, on the Achæan
side, in the Iliad; and the connexion
of the catalogue with the
other parts of the poem does not
seem to intimate as to prove
this exception to have been intended
by the writer of the fifth
book. Tlepolemus must therefore
be considered as a Grecian
of the mother country. I feel
convinced, that, according to
Homer, no enemy of Troy comes
from the eastern side of the
Ægæan sea. Concerning the
numerous differences between
the catalogue and the genuine
Homeric traditions, see the

instances of modern fiction in
the narrative of Pausanias.
The account of Polychares and
Euæphnus supposes a greater
power in the Areopagus than
it ever possessed; nor did the
quarrel come at all within the
province of the Argive Amphictyons.
Besides Pausanias,
see Diodorus Excerpt, p. 547,
who generally follows the same
authorities. The Cretan bowmen
must have been introduced
by Rhianus from his own country;
it is certain that there were
no mercenaries at so early a period.
How could the Corinthians
have gone to Laconia
without passing through an
enemy's country, and who would
have allowed them a free passage?
The flight of the initiated
to Eleusis is contrary to all probability; and this the more, as
in the second war they were
quiet spectators, Pausan. IV.
16. 1. Yet we are told the
sacred torchbearers (δᾳδοῦχοι)
fought at Athens in military
array. The disposition of the
light-armed troops in separate
bodies (IV. 7. 2.) is contrary
to the account of Tyrtæus and
to ancient usage, compare IV.
8. 4. Οἱ Μεσσήνιοι δρόμῳ ἐς
τοὺς Λακεδαιμονίους ἐχρῶντο
(IV. 18. 1.) is contrary to Herodotus
(VI. 112). Many events
are attributed to very improbable
causes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> that they left
the fortified cities (IV. 9. 1.)
from want of money. There is
absolutely no reason given for
the subjection of Messenia.
That the Argives came in a
private capacity, and not at the
command of the state, appears
from Herodot. VI. 92. The
oracle in IV. 9. 2. in iambic
verses is of a late date, but nevertheless
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> ancient than the
corresponding one in hexameters
preserved by Eusebius Præp.

It is stated by Strabo, p. 355 C.
that at the ἐσχάτη κατάλυσις τῶν
Μεσσηνίων the Eleans assisted
the Spartans. They must therefore
have espoused the cause of
the latter out of hatred towards
Pisa. With Strabo agrees the
article of Phavorinus in v.
Αὐγείας, p. 134. viz. that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Lacedæmonians deprived the
Pisatans of this privilege for
siding with Messenia, and
gave it to the Eleans, who
took their part.”</span> But if Elis
was friendly and Pisa hostile to
the Spartans, Pantaleon can
hardly have obtained the agonothesia,
when Sparta had overcome
all her enemies, and had
ended the war victoriously. Accordingly,
the 34th Olympiad,
which Pantaleon celebrated
without the Eleans, probably
fell in the period of the second

nothing surprising in Tyrtæus,

speaking of the whole nation in

of his brother in Macedonia, the
relation of this narrative to that
in Herodotus VIII. 137. appears
to me to be as follows.
Both describe the same event;
but the latter is the rude native
tradition of Macedon, formed
among a people which had few
historical memorials; the former
is derived from an Argive tradition,
and, though as well as
the other not purely historical,
is yet connected together in a
more probable manner. Κάρανος
is perhaps only another
form of Κοίρανος; see Hesychius
in Κόραννος. The account of
Euripides, that Archelaus, the
son of Temenus, took the city
of Ægæ in Macedonia, whither
he had come as a goatherd in
great distress (Hyginus Fab.
219; Dio Chrysost. p. 70.), is
the most unfounded. Whether
Isocrates (ad Philipp. p. 88. D.)
was acquainted with the tradition
concerning Caranus, or followed
the account of Herodotus,
does not appear. There is also
a discrepancy in the account of
Constant. Porphyr. Them. I.

the tyrant of Zancle, being driven
out by the Samians (Olymp. 70.

of Persia, and remained chiefly
at his court. To Scythes' son,
Cadmus, the king of Persia probably
gave the island of Cos.
For though it might be objected
that Cadmus could not have
been the son of Scythes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of Zancle</span></em>,
since the latter, according
to Herodotus, died in Persia (ἐν

the tyranny from his

be answered that Scythes, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">notwithstanding</span></em>
that the king had
given him the government of
Cos, yet did not reside there,
but at the Persian court, as we
know to have been the case with
Histiæus. Afterwards, however,
before the 75th Olympiad (480
B.C.), having made a treaty
with the Samians, he returned
to his ancient country. He
was followed by Epicharmus
the comic poet, Suidas, in v.
Ἐπίχαρμος. At his departure
from Cos he gave the state its
liberty, and instituted a senate
(βουλή). He was a contemporary
of Hippolochus the Asclepiad,
and the ancestor by the
mother's side of Thessalus. See

likewise, a Megarian colony,
had a temple of Apollo on the
promontory of Metopon, according
to Dionysius de Bosp.
Thrac. Byzantium, moreover,
had evidently derived from its
parent city, but in an exaggerated
form, the tradition of the
foundation of the city by Apollo,
and that this god placed his lyre
upon a tower. Hence the seven
resounding towers (Hesych.
Miles, ap. Codin. p. 2. 3. Dionys.
Byz. p. 6. Dio Cass.
LXXIV. 14): also the fable
of the dolphin charmed by the
sound of the lyre (Dionysius

to the Megarian worship.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_996" name="note_996" href="#noteref_996">996.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Homer. Hymn.

while the three winter months
were sacred to Bacchus, and
hence in them the dithyramb

Orestes sits, half kneeling,

describes it: by his side are
Athene and the Furies; next
the tripod is the sacred laurel,

with a laurel chaplet, and his
mantle thrown back; the spirit
of Clytæmnestra and Pylades
in the background. On a vase
in the British Museum (No.
102), Orestes is represented as
kneeling, with a sword in his
hand, and a travelling cap
thrown from his head, before an
altar; woollen fillets, in the
form of a chain, fall from one
arm; Apollo, with a branch of
laurel and a patera in one hand,
stands by him; and in the
other, as it appears, a pair of
shears, with which he is going
to cut off a lock of his hair.

of this fable (Herod. VII. 216.

called the Cercopes Œchalians,
